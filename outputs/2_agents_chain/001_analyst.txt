### Key Trends, Correlations, and Anomalies  
- **Physical Dimensions**: Strong positive correlation between `wheel-base`, `length`, `width`, and `curb-weight` (e.g., longer vehicles are heavier).  
- **Performance Metrics**: `engine-size`, `horsepower`, and `num-of-cylinders` correlate positively (e.g., larger engines = more power).  
- **Efficiency Trade-offs**: Negative correlation between `horsepower` and fuel efficiency (`city-mpg`/`highway-mpg`). High-performance vehicles (e.g., 288 HP) have low MPG.  
- **Price Drivers**: `price` correlates with `engine-size` (r≈0.87), `horsepower` (r≈0.81), and luxury brands (e.g., Jaguar/Porsche).  
- **Anomalies**:  
  - Three rear-engine vehicles (vs. 202 front-engine).  
  - Twelve-cylinder engines and compression ratio=23 are engineering outliers.  
  - `normalized-losses` has 20% missing data, limiting safety analysis.

### Enrichment Recommendations  
1. **Safety Ratings** (for `symboling`/`normalized-losses`):  
   - Add IIHS/NHTSA crash-test ratings by `make` and `body-style` to validate risk scores.  
2. **Environmental Data** (for `fuel-type`/`mpg`):  
   - Integrate CO₂ emissions (EPA datasets) using `engine-size` and `fuel-system`.  
3. **Market Context** (for `price`/`make`):  
   - Join with sales volume or reliability ratings (J.D. Power) by `make`.  
4. **Vehicle Class Segmentation**:  
   - Add "vehicle class" (e.g., SUV, sedan) using `curb-weight` and `body-style` (map to NHTSA categories).  
5. **Feature-Based Enrichment**:  
   - Include transmission type (manual/automatic) and safety features (ABS, airbags) to explain `price` and `symboling`.  
6. **Geographic Data**:  
   - Link manufacturing country by `make` to analyze regional trends (e.g., European = higher `horsepower`).  

*Enrichment Goal*: Contextualize performance/safety metrics and explain price variations.
