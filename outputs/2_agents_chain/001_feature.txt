| **Power-to-Weight Ratio**    | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Critical for performance evaluation. Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and sportiness, influencing price and desirability.          | EDA shows strong correlation between horsepower, curb-weight, and price. This ratio quantifies performance efficiency beyond raw power.         |
| **Combined MPG**             | `(city_mpg * 0.55) + (highway_mpg * 0.45)`                              | Represents real-world fuel efficiency. Key for cost-of-ownership and environmental impact assessments.                                       | EDA reveals trade-offs between horsepower and MPG. Standard weighting balances urban/rural driving patterns for holistic efficiency metrics.    |
| **Turbo Indicator**          | `1 if aspiration == 'turbo' else 0`                                     | Turbocharging boosts power and efficiency. Signals premium/performance trim, affecting price and insurance risk.                             | Turbocharged vehicles (37/205) are less common and may command price premiums. Directly linked to performance metrics.                         |
| **Displacement per Cylinder**| `engine_size / num_of_cylinders`                                        | Reveals engine design philosophy (e.g., high displacement/cylinder = torque focus). Impacts drivability and fuel efficiency.                 | EDA notes outliers in cylinder count (up to 12) and engine size. This normalizes for fair comparison across engine configurations.            |
| **Specific Output**          | `horsepower / engine_size`                                              | Measures engineering efficiency (power per unit displacement). Higher values indicate advanced tech (e.g., turbocharging).                   | Engine size and horsepower correlate strongly (râ‰ˆ0.87). This ratio isolates engineering quality beyond raw displacement.                     |
| **RWD Indicator**            | `1 if drive_wheels == 'rwd' else 0`                                     | RWD is associated with performance/luxury vehicles. Affects handling characteristics and insurance risk.                                     | RWD vehicles (76/205) correlate with higher prices. Differentiates sportier models from common FWD (120/205).                                |
| **4WD Indicator**            | `1 if drive_wheels == '4wd' else 0`                                     | Signals off-road capability or all-weather performance. Impacts resale value and maintenance costs.                                          | Rare (9/205) but valuable for SUVs/trucks. Explains price variations in utility segments.                                                   |
| **Diesel Indicator**         | `1 if fuel_type == 'diesel' else 0`                                     | Diesel engines offer higher torque and fuel economy. Affects TCO and buyer segmentation (e.g., commercial/long-haul use).                   | Diesel vehicles (20/205) are niche but distinct in efficiency profiles. Explains MPG outliers.                                               |
| **Stability Factor**         | `(wheel_base * curb_weight) / (height * 1000)`                          | Quantifies rollover resistance. Higher values indicate safer handling, reducing insurance risk.                                             | EDA links wheelbase/height to stability. Heavy vehicles (>3500 lbs) are outliers; this captures safety physics.                              |
| **Convertible Indicator**    | `1 if body_style == 'convertible' else 0`                               | Convertibles have higher insurance risk and luxury appeal. Explains price premiums and safety ratings.                                        | Rare body style (6/205) with distinct risk profile. Symboling analysis may underrepresent open-top risks.                                    |
| **Luxury Brand Indicator**   | `1 if make in ['bmw','jaguar','porsche','mercedes'] else 0` (domain list)| Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, technology, and performance. Critical for market segmentation.                        | EDA shows luxury brands drive high-price outliers (>$30k). This binary feature isolates premium segments without target leakage.              |
| **Footprint Area**           | `length * width`                                                        | Determines interior space and parking difficulty. Influences practicality ratings and urban usability.                                       | Strong correlation between dimensions (length/width/curb-weight). Captures spatial efficiency beyond individual measurements.                |

### Rationale Summary
- **Performance & Efficiency**: Features like **Power-to-Weight Ratio**, **Specific Output**, and **Combined MPG** directly model trade-offs between power and efficiency observed in EDA. They quantify engineering excellence critical for pricing.
- **Market Segmentation**: **Luxury Brand**, **RWD**, and **Convertible** indicators isolate high-value segments. EDA confirms these attributes drive price outliers and insurance risk variations.
- **Safety & Stability**: **Stability Factor** and **Convertible Indicator** address safety implications from physical dimensions and body style, explaining symboling (risk rating) anomalies.
- **Engineering Insights**: **Displacement per Cylinder** and **Turbo Indicator** decode engine design choices, helping differentiate mainstream vs. performance models.
- **Practicality**: **Footprint Area** and **4WD Indicator** capture usability factors affecting buyer preferences in urban (parking) or off-road contexts.

*External Enrichment Note*: Safety ratings (IIHS/NHTSA) would enhance **Stability Factor** and **symboling** interpretation but require external data.
