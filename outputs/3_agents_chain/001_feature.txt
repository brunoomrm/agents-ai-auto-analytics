### Proposed Feature Engineering Suggestions

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight**      | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Quantifies acceleration performance; high ratios indicate sportier vehicles.  | EDA shows horsepower and curb-weight strongly correlate with price. High-risk vehicles (symboling=3) have high horsepower – this ratio captures performance efficiency.       |
| **Engine Efficiency**    | `(bore² * stroke * num-of-cylinders * 0.785) / engine-size`             | Measures engine design precision; values ≠1 indicate oversquare/undersquare engines. | Bore/stroke symmetry (skew≈0) but engine-size skew=1.95. Diesel outliers (compression-ratio=23) may show distinct signatures. Helps differentiate engine architectures. |
| **Highway-City MPG Gap** | `highway-mpg - city-mpg`                                                | Indicates drivetrain optimization (e.g., highway-optimized RWD vs city-focused FWD). | FWD dominates (120 records). EDA notes highway/city MPG both right-skewed but negatively correlate with horsepower. Gap reveals usage-specific efficiency.              |
| **Turbo-Diesel Flag**    | `(aspiration == 'turbo') & (fuel-type == 'diesel')`                     | Flags high-torque, fuel-efficient configurations common in premium/luxury segments. | Turbocharged aspiration (37 records) links to high compression-ratio and horsepower. Diesel engines (20 records) show extreme compression ratios.                         |
| **Size Class**           | `(length * width) / 144`  // Area in sq-ft                              | Standardizes vehicle size for regulations/market segmentation (e.g., EPA classes). | Physical dimensions correlate (length/width/wheel-base). Larger vehicles (mean length=174") tend toward higher prices and weight.                                       |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**  | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders`                                         | Measures per-cylinder performance; highlights engineering refinement.         | num-of-cylinders highly skewed (skew=2.82); 75% ≤4 cylinders. High-performance outliers (horsepower=288) may show disproportionate output per cylinder.                  |
| **Safety-Risk Premium**  | `symboling * price`                                                     | Quantifies insurance cost impact on total ownership expense.                  | symboling (-3 to 3) has no missing values. High-risk vehicles (symboling=3) correlate with turbocharging and high horsepower – directly multiplies financial risk.       |
| **4WD Premium Flag**     | `(drive-wheels == '4wd') & (curb-weight > 3000)`                        | Identifies heavy off-road/sport-utility vehicles with higher manufacturing costs. | 4WD rare (9 records). EDA shows curb-weight (mean=2555 lbs) correlates with size. Heavy 4WD vehicles likely luxury/SUV segment.                                          |
| **Fuel System Advance**  | `1 if fuel-system in ['mpfi','idi'] else 0`                             | Flags advanced injection systems for performance/emissions control.           | MPFI is most common (94 records). Turbocharged engines may use advanced systems; links to horsepower and compression-ratio trends.                                        |
| **Luxury Density**       | `price / (length * width * height)`                                     | Measures cost per cubic unit – high values indicate premium materials/features. | Price outliers ($45.4K) align with max engine-size (326) and horsepower (288). Rear-engine vehicles (3 records) may show extreme density.                                |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance Metrics** (*Power-to-Weight, Cylinder Efficiency*): Directly leverage EDA insights on horsepower-engine-size-price correlations to quantify performance economics.  
- **Efficiency Signals** (*Engine Efficiency, MPG Gap*): Decouple city/highway efficiency trends and engine design characteristics, addressing fuel-economy correlations with power.  
- **Market Segmentation** (*Size Class, Turbo-Diesel Flag, 4WD Premium*): Use physical/engine traits to create proxies for vehicle classes (SUVs, luxury, performance) noted in enrichment recommendations.  
- **Risk Monetization** (*Safety-Risk Premium*): Multiplies symbolic risk ratings with price to model real-world insurance cost impacts.  
- **Material/Feature Premium** (*Luxury Density*): Captures high-end outliers by measuring price against physical volume, isolating premium engineering.  

Features avoid columns with >5% missing data (e.g., normalized-losses) and align with analyst-identified trends: turbo-diesel links, dimensional correlations, and risk-performance relationships.
