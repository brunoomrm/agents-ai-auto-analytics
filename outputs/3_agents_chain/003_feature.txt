| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Critical for acceleration performance. High ratios indicate sports/luxury vehicles. | EDA shows strong negative correlation between horsepower and mpg. This ratio quantifies performance efficiency, explaining price variations in performance-oriented vehicles. |
| **Fuel Economy Index**   | `(city-mpg * 0.55) + (highway-mpg * 0.45)`                              | Real-world efficiency metric weighing city driving more heavily.              | City/highway mpg have similar distributions. Weighted average reflects typical usage patterns, helping predict operating costs and environmental impact.                 |
| **Engine Efficiency Score** | `(boreÂ² * stroke * compression-ratio) / (engine-size + 1e-5)`           | Measures volumetric efficiency. Higher values indicate advanced engine design. | Diesel engines (high compression-ratio outliers) have different efficiency profiles. This captures thermodynamic efficiency beyond displacement size.                   |
| **Luxury Segment Flag**  | `1 if (drive-wheels == 'rwd') OR (num-of-cylinders >= 8) else 0`        | Identifies premium vehicles (RWD/V8+ common in luxury/sports cars).           | EDA shows RWD correlates with higher prices. Combines drivetrain and cylinder count to isolate luxury segment where price-risk relationships break.                      |
| **Size Compactness**     | `(length * width * height) / curb-weight`                               | Measures spatial efficiency. Lower values indicate dense packaging (e.g., SUVs). | Strong size-weight correlation exists. This ratio helps segment vehicles by utility (family vs. compact) affecting insurance risk and fuel economy.                       |
| **Turbo Premium**        | `1 if aspiration == 'turbo' and fuel-type == 'gas' else 0`              | Flags performance-enhanced gasoline engines with higher output.                | Turbocharged engines (18% prevalence) likely boost horsepower disproportionately. Explains outliers in performance metrics.                                               |
| **Safety Deficit**       | `normalized-losses / (curb-weight / 1000)`                              | Normalizes insurance losses by weight. Higher values indicate poor crash safety. | Heavy vehicles often have lower damage susceptibility. This adjusts for mass, improving risk assessment where symboling lacks linearity.                                |
| **Diesel Signature**     | `1 if (compression-ratio > 14) AND (fuel-type == 'diesel') else 0`      | Reliably identifies diesel tech without relying solely on fuel-type.           | Compression-ratio >14 is diesel-exclusive per EDA. Critical for efficiency/price modeling as diesels have distinct characteristics.                                     |
| **NHTSA Safety Rating**  | `External: Map make and body-style to IIHS/NHTSA crash test ratings`    | Provides objective safety assessment beyond insurance data.                    | Symboling and normalized-losses have interpretation gaps. External safety ratings resolve ambiguity, especially for luxury vehicles with mixed risk scores.             |
| **CO2 Intensity**        | `External: EPA emissions data mapped to city-mpg/highway-mpg`           | Quantifies environmental impact for regulatory compliance.                     | Fuel economy alone doesn't capture emissions. Direct CO2 data (g/mile) enriches efficiency analysis and aligns with modern automotive standards.                        |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance Dynamics**: Power-to-Weight Ratio and Turbo Premium capture engineering trade-offs between horsepower, weight, and forced induction - critical for pricing sports/luxury vehicles where EDA noted non-linear risk-price relationships.
- **Efficiency Refinement**: The Fuel Economy Index and Engine Efficiency Score contextualize mpg data with real-world usage and thermodynamic principles, while CO2 Intensity (external) addresses environmental factors beyond fuel consumption.
- **Market Segmentation**: Luxury Segment Flag and Diesel Signature use drivetrain, cylinder count, and compression characteristics to isolate premium/diesel niches that behave differently in pricing and risk profiles.
- **Safety Enhancement**: Safety Deficit adjusts loss data for vehicle mass, and NHTSA Safety Rating (external) provides authoritative crash data to decode symboling anomalies, particularly for high-value vehicles.
- **Design Intelligence**: Size Compactness quantifies packaging efficiency, explaining correlations between dimensions and weight for consumer preference modeling.

These features leverage EDA findings (e.g., diesel compression outliers, RWD-price links) while addressing data gaps through practical transformations and prioritized external enrichments (safety/emissions data). They collectively enhance predictive power for price, risk, and efficiency outcomes by incorporating automotive engineering principles.
