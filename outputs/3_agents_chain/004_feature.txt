### Feature Engineering Suggestions

| Feature Name          | Formula                                     | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **power_efficiency_index** | `horsepower / highway-mpg`                | Quantifies performance-fuel efficiency tradeoff. Higher values indicate performance-oriented vehicles with greater power per efficiency unit. | EDA shows strong negative correlation between horsepower and mpg. This ratio captures market segmentation (e.g., sports vs economy cars) affecting price and insurance risk. |
| **weight_to_power**   | `curb-weight / horsepower`                  | Measures vehicle agility. Lower ratios indicate better acceleration and performance, influencing desirability and price. | Performance outliers (horsepower=288) and curb-weight correlations suggest this classic metric explains premium pricing and higher symboling risk. |
| **size_index**        | `(length + width) * height`                 | Represents overall vehicle footprint. Larger values indicate more interior space and stability, affecting comfort and safety ratings. | EDA shows size dimensions correlate. This combines them holistically to predict vehicle class (SUV/sedan) and relate to normalized-losses. |
| **engine_efficiency** | `compression-ratio * (engine-size / num-of-cylinders)` | Combines thermodynamic efficiency with displacement per cylinder. Higher values indicate advanced engine design. | Diesel engines (high compression) and cylinder dominance patterns suggest this captures engineering sophistication affecting price and fuel economy. |
| **turbo_boost_flag**  | `(aspiration == 'turbo') * horsepower`      | Isolates horsepower enhancement from turbocharging. Highlights performance variants within same engine platforms. | Turbo models show 47% higher avg. horsepower. This flags forced-induction models that command price premiums and higher risk ratings. |
| **stability_factor**  | `wheel-base / (height * 0.5)`               | Measures rollover resistance. Higher values indicate better stability at speed, reducing accident risk. | Wheel-base correlates with size/weight; this ratio explains symboling risk for tall vehicles (SUVs) and rear-engine outliers. |
| **mpg_ratio**         | `highway-mpg / city-mpg`                    | Highlights drivetrain optimization. Values >1 indicate highway-tuned gearing; near 1 indicates balanced efficiency. | Highway-mpg averages 32% higher than city-mpg. Large variations suggest this reveals transmission/engine tuning strategies. |
| **diesel_efficiency** | `(fuel-type == 'diesel') * compression-ratio` | Captures diesel's inherent efficiency advantage. Non-diesel vehicles get 0, isolating this technology effect. | Diesel compression ratios (avg 20) are 2x gasoline engines. This explains their fuel economy benefits and potential price premiums. |
| **cylinder_compactness** | `bore / stroke`                          | Engine design characteristic. Ratios >1 indicate high-RPM performance engines; <1 indicate torque-focused designs. | Bore/stroke distributions show symmetry. This classic metric explains power delivery (e.g., sports cars vs trucks) affecting price. |
| **safety_volume**     | `normalized-losses * curb-weight`           | Proxy for crash energy management. Higher values indicate greater structural integrity demands. | Heavier vehicles often have lower losses. This interaction estimates crashworthiness, explaining symboling variance when safety data is missing. |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance & Market Positioning**: `power_efficiency_index`, `weight_to_power`, and `turbo_boost_flag` target performance-oriented buyers. They explain price premiums for sports/luxury vehicles and higher insurance risks through quantifiable engineering metrics.
- **Efficiency Engineering**: `engine_efficiency`, `diesel_efficiency`, and `mpg_ratio` capture powertrain sophistication. These link to operating costs and emissions complianceâ€”critical for modern automotive segments.
- **Safety & Stability**: `stability_factor` and `safety_volume` address crash safety and dynamics. They fill gaps in normalized-losses data using physical proxies, directly informing symboling risk predictions.
- **Design Integration**: `size_index` and `cylinder_compactness` reflect holistic vehicle architecture. They translate dimensions/engine specs into class segmentation and drivability insights.

Features leverage EDA findings (e.g., diesel compression anomalies, turbo power boosts) while adhering to practical automotive engineering principles. External enrichments weren't required as the schema supports robust derivations.
