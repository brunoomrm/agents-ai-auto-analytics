### Feature Engineering Suggestions

| Feature Name              | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb_weight`                                              | Critical performance metric affecting acceleration and drivability. Higher ratios indicate sportier vehicles.                                | EDA shows strong correlation between horsepower, weight, and price. This ratio quantifies performance efficiency, explaining price premiums (e.g., Porsche outliers).        |
| **Combined Fuel Efficiency** | `0.45 * city_mpg + 0.55 * highway_mpg`                                | Real-world fuel economy estimate impacting ownership costs and emissions. Standard metric for consumer comparisons.                         | MPG negatively correlates with engine-size/weight. Combining both metrics provides a holistic efficiency measure for price and environmental impact modeling.              |
| **Engine Design Ratio**   | `bore / stroke`                                                         | Distinguishes engine characteristics: >1 (high-RPM performance), <1 (high-torque). Affects power delivery and fuel efficiency.              | Symmetric bore and left-skewed stroke distributions suggest design variations. Diesel engines (high compression-ratio) may show distinct ratios, explaining efficiency differences. |
| **Turbo Performance Flag** | `1 if aspiration == 'turbo' else 0`                                   | Identifies forced-induction engines with boosted power output, linked to premium pricing and fuel trade-offs.                              | Turbocharged vehicles show 47% higher avg. horsepower but lower MPG. This binary flag isolates performance variants affecting price and risk (symboling anomalies).        |
| **Luxury Drivetrain Flag** | `1 if drive_wheels in ['RWD','4WD'] and curb_weight > 2800 else 0`    | Flags performance/luxury vehicles (RWD/4WD) with substantial weight. Explains price premiums and insurance risk profiles.                  | RWD/4WD vehicles have 24% higher avg. price than FWD. Weight threshold captures luxury builds (e.g., BMW, Mercedes) noted in EDA outliers.                               |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**   | `engine_size / num_of_cylinders`                                        | Measures displacement per cylinder, indicating engine sophistication. Higher values correlate with advanced designs (e.g., V8s).            | Right-skewed engine-size and cylinder distributions. This ratio differentiates standard 4-cyl (≈60 cu.in/cyl) from performance engines (e.g., 12-cyl at 27.2 cu.in/cyl). |
| **Diesel Indicator**      | `1 if compression_ratio > 15 else 0`                                    | Flags diesel engines without relying on fuel-type, capturing high-compression efficiency and torque characteristics.                        | Compression-ratio >15 strongly predicts diesel (20/20 cases). Diesel-specific features affect resale value and maintenance costs (linked to normalized-losses).         |
| **Size-to-Weight Ratio**  | `(length * width * height) / curb_weight`                               | Quantifies build density. Lower ratios indicate heavier construction (safety/luxury), higher ratios suggest space efficiency.               | Dimensions and weight are correlated (r>0.8). Luxury vehicles (high curb-weight) may prioritize structural density, while compacts maximize interior space.               |
| **Safety-Risk Adjustment**| `symboling * normalized_losses`                                         | Interaction term highlighting high-risk vehicles with expensive repairs. Directly links safety ratings to insurance costs.                  | EDA notes symboling-risk mismatches (e.g., high-performance cars with low-risk scores). Product term amplifies high-cost/high-risk combinations.                         |
| **Highway Efficiency Premium** | `highway_mpg - city_mpg`                                             | Measures efficiency gain on highways. Larger gaps indicate engines optimized for cruising (e.g., diesel/turbo).                            | Diesel engines show 35% larger mpg gaps than gas. Reflects drivetrain optimization – valuable for segmenting family vs. performance vehicles.                           |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance & Market Positioning**: Features like *Power-to-Weight Ratio* and *Turbo Performance Flag* directly link engineering specs to market segmentation (economy vs. luxury). EDA confirms horsepower/weight correlations with price outliers.
- **Efficiency Dynamics**: *Combined Fuel Efficiency* and *Highway Efficiency Premium* model real-world ownership costs. These capture trade-offs between engine-size, fuel-type, and MPG noted in EDA.
- **Engineering Signatures**: *Engine Design Ratio* and *Cylinder Efficiency* decode technical nuances. Diesel/high-compression engines exhibit distinct signatures affecting both performance and maintenance costs.
- **Risk & Value**: *Safety-Risk Adjustment* and *Luxury Drivetrain Flag* address anomalies in insurance ratings and pricing. They reconcile symboling mismatches and drivetrain-based price premiums.
- **Practicality**: All features use existing attributes with minimal transformations, avoiding fictitious data. Enrichments (e.g., safety ratings) remain recommendations for future augmentation.
