### Feature Engineering Suggestions

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                             | Critical performance metric: Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and handling, directly influencing price and desirability.          | EDA shows strong correlation between horsepower, weight, and price. This ratio quantifies performance efficiency beyond raw horsepower alone. |
| **Engine Efficiency Index** | `(horsepower * compression-ratio) / engine-size`                       | Measures engine design efficiency: Combines power output, thermodynamic efficiency, and displacement for holistic performance assessment. | Diesel engines show high compression ratios and better highway MPG. This index captures engineering trade-offs affecting fuel economy and power. |
| **Vehicle Footprint**    | `length * width`                                                        | Regulatory/safety metric: Larger footprints improve stability but reduce maneuverability. Impacts safety ratings and insurance risk.        | Dimensions (length/width) correlate strongly with curb-weight. Symboling analysis links safety to vehicle size. |
| **MPG Differential**     | `highway-mpg - city-mpg`                                               | Highlights drivetrain optimization: Large gaps indicate highway-optimized designs (e.g., diesel), small gaps suggest urban adaptability. | Diesel vehicles show significantly better highway MPG. Turbocharged engines exhibit steeper city-MPG drops. |
| **Turbo-Diesel Interaction** | `1 if (aspiration == "turbo") and (fuel-type == "diesel") else 0`      | Flags high-torque configurations: Turbo-diesels command price premiums and offer unique efficiency/durability advantages.                  | Turbo and diesel are minority features with synergistic effects on performance and MPG (per EDA trends). |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**  | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders`                                        | Isolates per-cylinder performance: Reveals engineering sophistication (e.g., turbocharging, advanced combustion).                          | High-performance outliers (e.g., 288 HP) likely use advanced cylinder tech. Helps segment economy vs. performance engines. |
| **Safety-Weight Profile** | `symboling * curb-weight`                                              | Encodes mass-safety relationship: Heavy vehicles typically have better crash protection (negative symboling = safer).                      | EDA notes low-symboling vehicles correlate with high curb-weight. This interaction quantifies safety-design tradeoffs. |
| **Aerodynamic Ratio**    | `width / height`                                                        | Estimates drag impact: Lower ratios improve fuel efficiency and high-speed stability. Critical for EV/hybrid designs.                     | Width has positive skew, height is symmetric. Ratio explains MPG variance unexplained by engine specs alone. |
| **Premium Segment Flag** | `1 if (engine-location == "rear") or (num-of-cylinders >= 8) else 0`   | Identifies luxury/performance models: Rear engines and 8+ cylinders are rare markers of high-end vehicles.                                | Only 3 rear-engine vehicles exist (Porsche 911 type). High-cylinder engines correlate with price outliers. |
| **Displacement Density** | `engine-size / (bore**2 * stroke * num-of-cylinders * 0.25 * π)`       | Computes actual displacement vs. theoretical: Values ≠1 indicate advanced tech (e.g., turbo, variable valve timing).                     | Formula calculates theoretical displacement from bore/stroke. Deviations reveal engineering innovations affecting performance. |

### Rationale Summary
- **Performance & Efficiency**:  
  *Power-to-Weight Ratio* and *Engine Efficiency Index* directly link engineering parameters to real-world performance and fuel economy. They explain price differentials between economy and performance vehicles while quantifying trade-offs observed in EDA (e.g., turbocharged engines boost power but reduce MPG).

- **Safety & Regulation**:  
  *Vehicle Footprint* and *Safety-Weight Profile* leverage the EDA-identified correlation between size, weight, and insurance risk. These features help model safety ratings (symboling) and meet regulatory needs for stability/footprint analysis.

- **Market Segmentation**:  
  *Turbo-Diesel Interaction* and *Premium Segment Flag* target niche segments with distinct pricing/efficiency behaviors. They isolate high-value configurations (turbo-diesels) and exclusive models (rear-engine sports cars) that defy mainstream trends.

- **Advanced Engineering**:  
  *Displacement Density* and *Cylinder Efficiency* decode engine design sophistication. They reveal "hidden" tech like forced induction or advanced combustion – critical for explaining outliers in horsepower and compression ratios.
