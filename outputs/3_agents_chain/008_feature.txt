| Feature Name              | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Critical performance metric: Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and handling. Impacts insurance risk and desirability.              | EDA shows strong correlation between horsepower and weight. Normalizing power by weight creates a standardized performance indicator relevant for sports/luxury vehicles.       |
| **MPG Differential**      | `highway-mpg - city-mpg`                                                | Reveals drivetrain optimization: Larger gaps indicate highway-optimized engines; smaller gaps suggest city efficiency.                      | EDA confirms negative horsepower-MPG correlation. This feature quantifies efficiency trade-offs between driving conditions, explaining fuel economy variations.                |
| **Displacement per Cylinder** | `engine-size / num-of-cylinders`                                      | Indicates engine sophistication: High values suggest performance tuning; low values may indicate efficiency focus.                          | EDA notes engine-size outliers and cylinder count skew. This ratio exposes engineering trade-offs in combustion design affecting power delivery.                               |
| **Turbo Power Boost**     | `horsepower * (1.5 if aspiration=='turbo' else 1)`                      | Captures forced induction impact: Turbochargers significantly increase power output, affecting performance and price premiums.              | Turbocharged vehicles (18% of data) likely contribute to high-price outliers. This multiplier quantifies their performance advantage.                                         |
| **Diesel Engine Flag**    | `1 if fuel-type=='diesel' else 0`                                       | Highlights efficiency characteristics: Diesel engines have distinct compression ratios, torque profiles, and maintenance costs.             | EDA identifies diesel-specific compression ratio outliers (max=23). This flag isolates their unique performance/efficiency trade-offs.                                       |
| **Footprint Ratio**       | `(length * width) / curb-weight`                                        | Measures structural density: Lower values indicate heavier construction (safety), higher values suggest lightweight design (efficiency).   | Strong dimension-weight correlations in EDA. This ratio links vehicle proportions to safety and efficiency outcomes.                                                          |
| **High-Risk Indicator**   | `1 if symboling >= 1 else 0`                                            | Simplifies risk segmentation: Flags vehicles with above-neutral insurance risk (sports/luxury cars) for pricing and safety analysis.        | Symboling mode=0 with right skew. Binarizing identifies risk-prone vehicles that may command price premiums or higher insurance costs.                                        |
| **Specific Output**       | `horsepower / engine-size`                                              | Measures engine efficiency: Higher values indicate advanced engineering extracting more power per displacement unit.                        | Both horsepower and engine-size are right-skewed. This ratio benchmarks engineering quality across manufacturers.                                                             |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**   | `compression-ratio / num-of-cylinders`                                  | Reveals combustion design: High ratios in multi-cylinder engines indicate performance focus; low ratios suggest reliability/efficiency.    | Diesel outlier (ratio=23) and cylinder skew (mode=4) motivate this feature. Exposes engineering trade-offs in power generation.                                              |
| **Bore-Stroke Index**     | `bore / stroke`                                                         | Classifies engine geometry: >1 = high-RPM performance; <1 = torque-oriented. Affects driving characteristics and fuel economy.             | Near-normal bore and left-skewed stroke distributions. This classic metric explains engine behavior differences (e.g., sports cars vs. trucks).                               |
| **RWD Premium Weight**    | `curb-weight if drive-wheels=='rwd' else 0`                             | Isolates weight impact on RWD vehicles: Heavy RWD cars require stronger drivetrains, increasing production costs and performance.          | RWD vehicles (37%) correlate with price outliers. This interaction captures their unique engineering constraints and market positioning.                                     |
| **Volume Efficiency**     | `(city-mpg + highway-mpg) * engine-size / 100`                          | Measures efficiency per displacement: Balances MPG with engine size to compare fuel economy across vehicle classes fairly.                 | EDA shows MPG and engine-size correlations. Normalizing efficiency by displacement enables cross-category comparisons (e.g., SUVs vs sedans).                                 |

### Rationale Summary
Key engineered features address **performance**, **efficiency**, and **market segmentation**:
- **Performance metrics** (Power-to-Weight, Turbo Boost, RWD Weight) explain price premiums for sports/luxury vehicles by quantifying engineering advantages. These directly link to EDA findings on horsepower, aspiration, and drivetrain outliers.
- **Efficiency features** (MPG Differential, Diesel Flag, Volume Efficiency) capture trade-offs between power and fuel economy. They operationalize EDA insights about diesel characteristics and MPG-engine size correlations.
- **Engineering signatures** (Bore-Stroke, Displacement/Cylinder, Specific Output) decode manufacturer design choices that affect reliability, maintenance costs, and driving experience. These leverage cylinder, bore, and stroke analytics from EDA.
- **Risk/safety indicators** (High-Risk, Footprint Ratio) simplify insurance-risk interpretation and connect vehicle dimensions to structural safety, supporting EDA-observed symboling trends.

All features use existing attributes to avoid fictitious data, with formulas designed for real-world implementation. External enrichments (e.g., safety ratings) remain recommendations for future augmentation.
