### 2. Key Trends, Correlations, and Anomalies

- **Strong Correlations**:  
  - **Positive**: `engine-size` ↔ `horsepower` (larger engines = more power), `curb-weight` ↔ `length`/`width` (heavier vehicles are larger), `horsepower` ↔ `price` (high-performance vehicles cost more).  
  - **Negative**: `city-mpg`/`highway-mpg` ↔ `engine-size`/`horsepower` (efficiency drops with power/size), `mpg` ↔ `curb-weight` (heavier = less efficient).  
  - Drive dynamics: `rwd` (rear-wheel drive) common in high-`horsepower`/`price` vehicles (e.g., sports cars).  

- **Anomalies**:  
  - **Compression-ratio**: Max=23 (typical max for gasoline is 12; likely diesel engines). Verify with `fuel-type`.  
  - **Engine-size**: 12-cylinder outliers (`num-of-cylinders`=12) correlate with max `horsepower` (288) and `price` ($45,400).  
  - **Engine-location**: 3 rear-engine vehicles (unusual; likely high-performance models).  
  - **Symboling**: -3 to 3 range, but mean=0.83 suggests dataset leans toward higher-risk vehicles.  

- **Missing Data Clusters**:  
  - `normalized-losses` missing 20% of values—may correlate with rare makes/engine types.  
  - `price`, `bore`, `stroke` missing 4 records each—check if same vehicles (e.g., prototypes/exotics).

### 3. Enrichment Recommendations

1. **Safety Ratings** (e.g., NHTSA/IIHS):  
   - Link via `make`/`body-style` to explain `symboling` and `normalized-losses`.  
   - Add columns: `crash-test-rating`, `theft-rate`.  

2. **Environmental Data** (e.g., EPA):  
   - Augment `mpg` with `CO2-emissions` (grams/mile) or `fuel-cost-annual`.  
   - Map `engine-type`/`fuel-system` to emission standards (e.g., Euro norms).  

3. **Vehicle Class Segmentation**:  
   - Add `vehicle-class` (e.g., SUV, compact) using `length`/`curb-weight` thresholds to group analysis.  

4. **Market Context**:  
   - Join sales data (e.g., by `make`) or depreciation rates to contextualize `price`.  
   - Add `model-year` (missing) to track technological trends.  

5. **Performance Metrics**:  
   - Enrich with `torque` (correlates with `horsepower`) and `0-60-mph` (acceleration) for performance models.  
   - Source: Automotive databases like Edmunds API.  

6. **Geographic Data**:  
   - Map `make` to `country-of-origin` (e.g., BMW→Germany) to analyze regional engineering trends.  

**Targeted Enrichment**:  
- For `compression-ratio` outliers: Verify diesel engines via external fuel-type specs.  
- For rear-engine anomalies (`engine-location`): Add `model-name` (e.g., Porsche 911).  
- For `normalized-losses`: Use IIHS theft statistics to fill missing values.
