### Explanation for This Car's Prediction
**Why did the model predict $7,170 for this Subaru?**  
The prediction is based on the car’s key technical details, which the model identified as the biggest drivers of price:
- **Engine size (108.0)**: Smaller than average, which typically *lowers* the price.  
- **Horsepower (82.0)**: Relatively low power for a car, making it *more affordable*.  
- **Highway fuel efficiency (37 mpg)**: High efficiency is desirable and *increases* the price slightly, but this is offset by the weaker engine.  
- **Make (Subaru)**: As a well-known brand, Subaru’s reputation and reliability are factored in.  
- **Engine type (OHCF)**: A common, standard engine design—no major premium or discount.  

Overall, the car’s **small engine and low horsepower** are the primary reasons it’s predicted at the lower-mid price range ($7,170). The good fuel efficiency and Subaru branding add some value but don’t override the impact of the weaker performance specs.

**Reliability of this prediction:**  
The model is **highly confident** for this car because:  
- All features (like Subaru make, OHCF engine) are common in the data the model learned from.  
- The prediction ($7,170) is very close to the actual price ($7,126)—only a $44 difference.  
- No rare or extreme values (e.g., a 200-mpg engine) confuse the model here.

### What the Performance Metrics Mean for You  
The model’s overall accuracy helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships make informed decisions:  
- **Typical error (Test RMSE: ~$3,000)**:  
  On average, predictions for unseen cars are within **$3,000 of the actual price**. For a $10,000 car, the model might suggest $9,000–$12,000.  
- **Explanatory power (Test R²: 0.881)**:  
  The model explains **88% of what makes car prices vary** (e.g., engine size, brand, efficiency). This means it captures most real-world factors affecting pricing.  

**Key takeaway for stakeholders**:  
This tool reliably estimates prices for most common cars, helping you set fair prices (sellers) or negotiate confidently (buyers). It’s less accurate for rare vehicles (e.g., vintage or custom builds) but performs well for standard models like this Subaru.
