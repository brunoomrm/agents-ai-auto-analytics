### Explanation for This Car's Prediction

**Why did the model predict $20,212 for this car?**  
The model estimated a higher price primarily because of two key features:  
1. **Brand (Audi)**: Audi is a luxury brand, and the model associates it with higher prices.  
2. **Engine Size (131.0)**: Larger engines typically increase a car's value, and this engine is above average.  

These features "pushed" the prediction upward. However, the **actual price ($10,295) is much lower than predicted**, suggesting this specific car might have unique characteristics *not fully captured* by the model. For example:  
- It could be an older Audi with high mileage.  
- It might have wear-and-tear issues (e.g., accidents, mechanical problems) not reflected in the data.  
- Rare combinations (like a luxury brand with very low fuel efficiency) can confuse the model.  

**Reliability of this prediction**:  
The model is **less certain** here. The $9,918 error is far larger than the typical $2,600 error (see metrics below). Luxury brands like Audi often have wider price ranges, making predictions trickier if the car's condition or history isn't fully detailed.

### What the Overall Metrics Mean for You  
- **Typical Error (RMSE: $2,627)**:  
  For most cars, predictions are within **~$2,600 of the actual price**. Use this as a "margin of error" when evaluating estimates.  
- **Explanatory Power (R²: 0.912)**:  
  The model explains **91% of price variations** based on features like brand, engine size, and fuel efficiency. This is strong—but real-world factors (e.g., vehicle condition, market trends) make up the remaining 9%.  

**For buyers/sellers**:  
- The model is reliable for **general pricing guidance** but may struggle with luxury/unusual cars.  
- Always cross-check predictions with real-world details (e.g., maintenance history, local demand).
