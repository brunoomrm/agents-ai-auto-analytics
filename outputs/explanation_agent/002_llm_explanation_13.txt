### Explanation for the Specific Car Prediction  
The model predicted this Toyota's price at **$10,752**, which is **$764 higher** than the actual price ($9,988). Here’s why:  

1. **Key factors increasing the predicted price**:  
   - **Toyota brand**: As a well-known, reliable brand, Toyotas typically hold higher resale value.  
   - **Fuel efficiency**: High highway mileage (32 MPG) and a strong fuel efficiency index (29.25) make this car economical to operate, which buyers often pay more for.  
   - **Engine type**: The OHC engine is efficient and commonly associated with dependable vehicles, adding to the perceived value.  

2. **Key factors reducing the predicted price**:  
   - **Engine size**: A smaller engine (122.0) usually lowers the price, as buyers often associate larger engines with power/performance.  

The model likely overvalued this car because it emphasized the **Toyota brand and fuel efficiency** more than the **smaller engine size**. Since Toyota is a common brand and all features (e.g., MPG, engine specs) fall within typical ranges, this prediction is **fairly reliable**—the error ($764) is smaller than the model’s average error of ~$2,627.

### What the Overall Metrics Mean for You  
- **Typical Error (RMSE: $2,627)**:  
  On average, the model’s predictions are off by **±$2,627** vs. actual prices. For context:  
  - Buyers/sellers can expect most predictions to be within a **$5,000 range** (e.g., a $10,000 prediction = true price between ~$7,400–$12,400).  
  - This helps gauge negotiation buffers or pricing risks.  

- **Explanatory Power (R²: 91.2%)**:  
  The model explains **91% of pricing factors** (e.g., brand, efficiency, engine). This means:  
  - It’s highly reliable for spotting trends (e.g., fuel-efficient cars commanding higher prices).  
  - Decision-makers can trust it for broad pricing strategies, but **always pair it with real-world expertise** (e.g., vehicle condition, local demand).  

In short: The model is a strong pricing guide, but use it as a **starting point**—not an absolute value—since unmeasured factors (e.g., mileage, accidents) can sway actual prices.
