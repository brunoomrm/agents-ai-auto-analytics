### Explanation of the Car's Predicted Price  
**Prediction accuracy:**  
The model predicted this Toyota's price at **$6,385**, very close to its actual price of **$6,488** (a difference of just **$103**). This small error is well below the model’s typical mistake of **~$2,627**, meaning the estimate is **highly reliable** for this car.

### Why the Model Predicted $6,385  
The price was driven by **three key features**:  
1. **High fuel efficiency**  
   - Highway mileage: **38 MPG**  
   - Fuel efficiency index: **34.2** (above average)  
   *Why it matters:* Higher fuel efficiency saves owners money on gas, making the car **more valuable*.  

2. **Toyota brand reputation**  
   - Make: **Toyota**  
   *Why it matters:* Toyotas hold their value well due to reliability and lower maintenance costs, **increasing the price**.  

3. **Smaller engine size**  
   - Engine: **92 cubic inches** (smaller than average)  
   - Engine type: **OHC** (efficient and common)  
   *Why it matters:* Smaller engines are cheaper to produce and maintain, **reducing the price** slightly.  

**Overall:**  
The car’s **strong fuel economy and Toyota brand** pushed the price up, while the **smaller engine** kept it from being higher. These factors are common in the data, so the prediction is **trustworthy**.

### What the Performance Metrics Mean for You  
- **Typical error (RMSE): ~$2,627**  
  On average, predictions are off by this amount. For context:  
  - If the model predicts a $10,000 car, the *actual price* usually falls between **$7,373–$12,627**.  
  - **Smaller errors = more reliable estimates**.  

- **Explanatory power (R²): 91.2%**  
  The model explains **91% of price differences** between cars. This is **very high**—like a weather forecast with 91% accuracy. Buyers/sellers can trust it captures the main pricing factors (brand, efficiency, etc.).  

**For decision-makers:**  
- Use predictions to **estimate fair prices** quickly.  
- Be cautious with rare/unusual cars (e.g., luxury brands or extreme features)—errors may be larger.
