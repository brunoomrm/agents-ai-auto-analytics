### Explanation for the Predicted Car Price

**Why the model predicted $10,752 (vs. the actual $9,988):**  
The model estimated a slightly higher price primarily due to three key factors:  
1. **Fuel efficiency:** Your Toyota's strong highway fuel economy (32 MPG) and high fuel efficiency index (29.25) make it desirable. Efficient cars typically command higher prices.  
2. **Brand reputation:** As a Toyota, the model factored in the brand's known reliability and strong resale value.  
3. **Engine characteristics:** The engine size (122.0) is moderate, but its efficient OHC (overhead cam) design is cost-effective to maintain, adding perceived value.  

The prediction is **$764 higher than actual**—a smaller gap than the model's typical $2,600 error. This suggests the estimate is reasonably reliable for this car.

### Why It's Not Cheaper  
- While the smaller engine size usually lowers prices, this was offset by Toyota's brand premium and excellent fuel efficiency.  
- No rare features or unusual specs were noted, so the model had good reference data.

### What the Overall Metrics Mean for You  
- **Typical prediction error (RMSE): $2,627**  
  → For most cars, predicted prices will be within **~$2,600** of the actual price. Useful for setting realistic expectations when pricing vehicles.  
- **Model accuracy (R²: 91.2%)**  
  → The model explains **over 91%** of price variations. This high reliability makes it valuable for:  
  - **Buyers:** Estimating fair market value.  
  - **Sellers:** Setting competitive prices.  
  - **Dealers:** Quickly valuing trade-ins or inventory.  

In short: The model is highly trustworthy for everyday pricing decisions, with errors being small relative to most car prices.
