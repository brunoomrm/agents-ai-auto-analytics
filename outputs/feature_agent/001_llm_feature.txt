Based on the dataset schema and automotive domain knowledge, here are 15 engineered features with detailed justifications:

| Feature Name               | Formula/Recipe                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Power-to-Weight Ratio      | `horsepower / curb_weight`                                                    | Measures performance efficiency - higher ratios indicate better acceleration and premium pricing potential | High-performance vehicles command premium prices. EDA shows wide horsepower (48-288 HP) and weight (1488-4066 lb) ranges. Combining them creates a standardized performance metric that correlates with price tiers. |
| Fuel Efficiency Index      | `(city_mpg * 0.55) + (highway_mpg * 0.45)`                                    | Represents real-world fuel costs - key economic factor for buyers             | EPA uses this weighting for official ratings. Separately, city/highway MPG show different distributions (EDA: city 13-46, highway 16-54). Weighted combination better reflects operating costs than either alone. |
| Engine Efficiency          | `horsepower / (engine_size / 1000)` (HP per liter)                            | Indicates engine technological sophistication - premium engines extract more power from displacement | Turbocharged/supercharged engines achieve higher values. EDA shows engine_size (61-326) and horsepower vary non-linearly. This ratio highlights engineering quality differences between economy and performance models. |
| Size Classifier            | `IF (length*width > 1000) THEN 'Large' ELSE 'Compact'` (sq inch threshold)    | Categorizes vehicles by interior space - directly linked to market segment and price positioning | EDA reveals strong correlation between physical dimensions and price. Wheelbase (86.6-120.9 in) and length/width products separate sedans from compacts. Improves model interpretability for size-based pricing. |
| Turbo Diesel Flag          | `(aspiration == 'turbo') AND (fuel_type == 'diesel')`                         | Identifies high-torque powertrains - diesel turbos command price premiums    | Combines two existing categoricals. Turbo diesels have 20-30% higher torque (implied by bore/stroke ratios in EDA), valued for towing/longevity. Small but profitable niche segment. |
| Cylinder Efficiency        | `horsepower / num_of_cylinders` (converted to numeric: four=4, six=6, etc.)   | Measures per-cylinder performance - indicates advanced combustion technology | EDA shows cylinder count strongly influences price. High values reveal premium engines (e.g., BMW 6-cyl vs base 4-cyl). More interpretable than raw cylinder count. |
| Safety Score Proxy         | `(curb_weight / 1000) + (num_of_cylinders / 2)`                               | Estimates crash safety - heavier vehicles with more cylinders absorb impact better | NHTSA data shows weight correlates with crash test results. Uses existing features to approximate safety without external data. Justified by insurance symboling range (-2 to 3) in schema. |
| Aerodynamic Ratio          | `width / height`                                                              | Indicates stability and drag efficiency - affects performance and fuel economy | Sports cars have lower, wider profiles (higher ratios). EDA shows width (60.3-72.3 in) and height (47.8-59.8 in) vary independently. Critical for electric/hybrid range estimation. |
| Luxury Brand Flag          | External mapping: `['bmw','mercedes','audi','jaguar','porsche'] = 1 else 0`   | Captures brand premium - luxury brands command 15-30% price premiums         | Make variable has 22 categories. Condenses strategic positioning into binary feature. External brand tier data from J.D. Power or similar. |
| Drivetrain Premium         | `IF drive_wheels == 'rwd' OR '4wd' THEN 1 ELSE 0`                             | Flags performance/utility drivetrains - RWD/4WD have higher manufacturing costs | RWD sports cars and 4WD SUVs dominate premium segments. EDA shows fwd=70% of economy models. Simplifies wheel drive categories. |
| Engine Stress Factor       | `(horsepower * peak_rpm) / 1000`                                              | Measures mechanical strain - high values indicate performance engines needing premium components | Combines power and rotational stress. EDA shows peak_rpm (4150-6600) correlates with price. Predicts maintenance costs and reliability. |
| Fuel System Efficiency     | `compression_ratio / engine_size` (normalized)                                | Indicates thermal efficiency - higher values suggest advanced combustion tech | Diesel engines (high compression) and performance gas engines benefit. EDA shows compression_ratio (7-23) varies by fuel type. Explains price differences within same engine size. |
| Size-to-Mileage Ratio      | `(length * width) / highway_mpg`                                              | Measures space efficiency - premium vehicles optimize both interior volume and efficiency | SUVs/luxury cars achieve lower values. Addresses trade-off between size (comfort) and efficiency (cost). EDA shows non-linear relationship. |
| Torque Estimate            | `(horsepower * 5252) / peak_rpm` (lb-ft)                                      | Proxy for acceleration performance - torque determines real-world drivability | Critical missing metric. Formula based on mechanical physics. Correlates with towing capacity and 0-60 mph times - key purchase factors for trucks/SUVs. |
| Production Complexity      | `num_of_cylinders * (1.5 IF aspiration=='turbo' ELSE 1)`                      | Estimates manufacturing cost - complex engines increase production expenses | Turbocharging adds 20-30% to engine costs. Combined with cylinders (4-12), creates gradation from economy to performance powertrains. Justified by price differentials in EDA. |

**Key Engineering Insights:**
1. **Performance Metrics:** 6 features directly quantify powertrain efficiency (Power-to-Weight, Engine Efficiency, Torque) since performance drives premium pricing
2. **Categorical Simplification:** Flags for luxury/turbo/diesel/RWD reduce high-cardinality categories into business-relevant binaries
3. **Size Utilization:** 3 features optimize spatial dimensions - critical for SUV/truck segments dominating the market
4. **Cost Proxies:** Production Complexity and Drivetrain Premium estimate manufacturing differentials that explain price gaps
5. **External Enrichment:** Only used where absolutely necessary (Luxury Brand), with verifiable industry data sources

All features use existing variables except Luxury Brand (external mapping) and Torque (physics-based calculation). Each addresses specific business dimensions: performance, efficiency, safety, manufacturing cost, and market positioning.
