### Engineered Feature Suggestions

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **power_to_weight**      | `horsepower` / `curb-weight`                                            | Directly impacts acceleration and performance. Higher ratios indicate sportier/more powerful vehicles. | Performance buyers prioritize power relative to vehicle mass. Curvature in EDA likely shows non-linear price effects for extreme values. |
| **combined_mpg**         | `(0.55 * city_mpg) + (0.45 * highway_mpg)`                              | Real-world fuel efficiency metric. Critical for operational costs and emissions compliance. | Standard EPA weighting reflects typical driving patterns. Reduces collinearity between city/highway MPG. |
| **engine_efficiency**    | `horsepower` / `engine-size`                                            | Measures engineering efficiency (power per unit displacement). High values indicate advanced tech (e.g., turbocharging). | Explains price premiums for small high-output engines. EDA shows engine-size correlates with price but isn't granular. |
| **safety_factor**        | `(3 - symboling) * curb-weight`                                         | Combines crash safety (lower symboling = safer) and mass protection. Heavy, low-symboling cars are safest. | Insurance risk (symboling) and vehicle mass both influence safety ratings. Product term captures interaction. |
| **aspiration_boost**     | `1 if aspiration=='turbo' else 0`                                       | Turbocharged engines command price premiums and affect performance/efficiency. | Turbo models show higher avg. horsepower in EDA. Binary flag isolates forced-induction impact. |
| **bore_stroke_ratio**    | `bore` / `stroke`                                                       | Engine design characteristic. Ratios >1 (oversquare) favor high-RPM power; <1 favor torque. | Explains engine behavior beyond displacement. Correlated with horsepower in EDA. |
| **luxury_size_index**    | `length * width * height`                                               | Interior volume proxy. Critical for comfort and market segmentation (luxury/family vehicles). | Larger dimensions correlate with luxury/SUV segments. Non-linear relationship with price. |
| **drivetrain_premium**   | `1 if drive-wheels in ['4wd', 'rwd'] else 0`                            | RWD/4WD systems typically command higher prices and appeal to performance/utility buyers. | FWD vehicles cluster in lower price brackets. Binary flag isolates premium drivetrains. |
| **fuel_cost_index**      | `(engine-size * 0.1) / combined_mpg`                                    | Estimates fuel cost per mile. Directly impacts total ownership cost. | Combines purchase (engine-size proxy) and operational costs. Explains diesel/hybrid premiums. |
| **aerodynamic_ratio**    | `width / height`                                                        | Lower ratios indicate sportier/stabler profiles. Affects handling and highway efficiency. | Sports cars show lower width/height ratios in EDA. Correlates with body-style and symboling. |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance Optimization**: `power_to_weight` and `engine_efficiency` directly quantify engineering achievements that command price premiums (e.g., sports cars). These explain non-linear price jumps better than raw horsepower.
- **Cost Drivers**: `combined_mpg` and `fuel_cost_index` model ownership economicsâ€”critical for budget-conscious segments. Diesel/turbo vehicles often trade higher upfront cost for better efficiency.
- **Safety & Comfort**: `safety_factor` and `luxury_size_index` target family/luxury buyers. Safety correlates with weight and symboling, while interior volume drives SUV/premium pricing.
- **Market Positioning**: `drivetrain_premium` and `aspiration_boost` isolate features that define vehicle niches (e.g., off-road 4WDs, turbocharged performance models).
- **Engineering Insights**: `bore_stroke_ratio` and `aerodynamic_ratio` provide technical context for performance/efficiency trade-offs, aiding interpretability in regression models.
