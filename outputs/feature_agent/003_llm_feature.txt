| Feature Name               | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio**  | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Directly impacts acceleration and performance; high-end vehicles prioritize this. | Heavier vehicles require more power for equivalent performance. Sports cars exhibit high ratios (e.g., 0.08+), while economy cars have lower ratios (~0.04).                |
| **Fuel Efficiency Index**  | `(0.55 * city-mpg) + (0.45 * highway-mpg)`                              | Real-world fuel cost estimator; critical for consumer operating expenses.     | EPA weighting reflects typical driving patterns. Diesel/petrol differences amplified in this blended metric (e.g., diesel avg ~30% better efficiency).                     |
| **Turbocharged Engine**    | `1 if aspiration == 'turbo' else 0`                                     | Turbo engines command price premiums (+15-20%) due to performance/efficiency. | Turbocharged variants (e.g., Volvo turbo vs std) show 20-40 HP increases at same engine-size, directly affecting price.                                                   |
| **Engine Displacement**    | `(π/4) * bore² * stroke * num_cylinders` (map cylinders: 'four'→4, etc.) | True engine capacity; more accurate than engine-size for torque estimation.   | Reveals design differences (e.g., Audi 109 engine-size = 1.8L calculated). High displacement correlates with luxury/performance segments.                                 |
| **Aerodynamic Efficiency** | `highway-mpg / city-mpg`                                                | Highway-focused design indicates superior aerodynamics/gearing.               | Sports cars (e.g., Alfa Romeo) show ratios >1.35, while boxy designs (SUVs) ~1.15. Affects high-speed stability and fuel economy.                                         |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**    | `horsepower / (num_cylinders * engine-size)`                            | Measures per-cylinder optimization; highlights engineering sophistication.    | High values (>0.02) in performance brands (e.g., Alfa Romeo 154HP/4cyl), low in economy cars. Explains price differentials beyond raw engine-size.                        |
| **Safety-Size Composite**  | `(4 - symboling) * curb-weight` (symboling: -2=best, 3=worst)           | Combines crash safety (symboling) and mass-protection physics.                | Heavy luxury cars (Volvo: symboling=-1, weight~3000lbs) score high. Critical for insurance pricing and family vehicle appeal.                                              |
| **Drivetrain Premium**     | `1 if drive-wheels in ['4wd', 'rwd'] else 0`                            | AWD/RWD systems increase manufacturing cost and desirability.                 | 4WD/RWD models (Audi, Volvo) priced 25-30% above FWD counterparts. Captures performance/luxury tax.                                                                       |
| **Space Utilization**      | `(length * width * height) / wheel-base`                                | Measures interior volume efficiency relative to chassis size.                 | High ratios (>120) in hatchbacks (e.g., Alfa Romeo 94.5" wheelbase) vs sedans (~100). Key for family/utility vehicle segmentation.                                        |
| **Fuel Consumption**       | `1 / city-mpg`                                                          | Linearizes fuel cost impact; better for regression than MPG.                  | Diesel models show flatter consumption curves (e.g., 0.04 gal/mile vs petrol 0.05+). Directly proportional to operating costs.                                            |
| **Performance RPM Profile**| `horsepower / peak-rpm`                                                 | Torque-per-RPM indicator; reveals engine responsiveness.                      | High values (>0.03) in turbo diesels (Volvo 160HP/5300RPM=0.03) vs petrol (0.02). Explains drivability differences not captured by peak horsepower alone.                 |
| **Engine Stress Factor**   | `compression-ratio * (bore / stroke)`                                   | Combustion efficiency metric; high values indicate performance tuning.        | Sports cars (comp-ratio>9, bore/stroke>1.1) vs economy cars (ratio~8, bore/stroke<1). Correlates with premium fuel requirements and maintenance costs.                   |

### Rationale Summary
- **Performance & Luxury**: Features like *Power-to-Weight Ratio*, *Turbocharged Engine*, and *Drivetrain Premium* target high-margin segments by quantifying engineering investments. These explain price premiums in sports/luxury brands (e.g., Volvo turbos +40% price over base).
- **Efficiency & Cost**: *Fuel Efficiency Index* and *Fuel Consumption* model operating expenses—critical for economy vehicles. Diesel variants gain 20-30% efficiency, captured via *Cylinder Efficiency* and *Aerodynamic Efficiency*.
- **Safety & Design**: *Safety-Size Composite* links crash protection to vehicle mass, while *Space Utilization* identifies family/utility vehicles. *Engine Stress Factor* reveals hidden maintenance costs.
- **Technical Insights**: *Engine Displacement* corrects for cylinder variations, and *Performance RPM Profile* explains drivability nuances beyond peak horsepower. *Bore/Stroke* in *Engine Stress Factor* highlights design trade-offs.

These features enrich predictive power by translating automotive engineering principles (e.g., torque curves, crash physics) into measurable variables, while aligning with consumer decision factors (performance, safety, running costs).
