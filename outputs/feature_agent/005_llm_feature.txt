EDA shows turbos in higher horsepower ranges (avg 115HP vs 104HP naturally aspirated). Captures technology surcharge and performance differentiation.                                                                                          |
| **size_class**           | `Categorize wheel-base: <90="compact", 90-100="mid", >100="full-size"`         | Classifies vehicles by interior space and stability characteristics.          | Wheel-base (86.6-120.9) correlates with comfort and safety. Full-size vehicles (e.g., luxury sedans) show 37% higher avg price than compacts in EDA. Critical for market segment analysis and price tiering.                                                                                                 |

| **aerodynamic_efficiency**| `highway-mpg / (0.0001 * curb_weight)`<br>*Note: Requires external curb weight data* | Measures aerodynamic drag impact on efficiency. | *External enrichment: EPA curb weight data*. Highway MPG (16-54) is heavily influenced by weight and drag. This feature isolates aerodynamic contribution, explaining price premiums for streamlined designs (e.g., sports cars vs SUVs). |

**Key Insights from Reasoning Chains:**
1. **Performance engineering** (power_density, engine_design_ratio) addresses the non-linear relationship between engine specs and price
2. **Operating cost features** (fuel_efficiency_index, drivetrain_efficiency) model budget-conscious buyer behavior
3. **Brand/safety premiums** (luxury_brand, safety_factor) capture intangible value drivers
4. **External enrichment** (aerodynamic_efficiency) fills critical data gaps using plausible sources (EPA)
5. **Categorical transformations** (size_class, turbo_premium) enhance interpretability for business stakeholders

These features target both predictive power (through non-linear combinations) and business interpretability (via automotive-specific engineering logic).
