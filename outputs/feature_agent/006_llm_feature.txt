### Engineered Features for Automotive Dataset

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Power-to-Weight Ratio    | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Key performance metric: Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and handling, directly influencing price and desirability.               | Performance-oriented buyers prioritize this ratio. Heavy vehicles with low horsepower feel sluggish, while light vehicles with high horsepower are sporty. |
| Fuel Efficiency Score    | `(city_mpg * 0.55) + (highway_mpg * 0.45)`                              | Real-world efficiency balance: Weights city driving slightly higher to reflect typical usage, impacting operating costs and emissions.      | EPA estimates show most driving occurs in cities. Helps segment eco-friendly vehicles and predict long-term ownership costs.                    |
| Engine Displacement      | `π * (bore/2)^2 * stroke * num_cylinders`                               | Precise engine capacity calculation: More accurate than "engine-size" alone, correlating with power, torque, and fuel consumption.          | "Engine-size" is precomputed; this uses fundamental dimensions (bore/stroke) to validate or enrich displacement data for performance modeling. |
| Aerodynamic Index        | `curb-weight / (width * height)`                                        | Estimates drag impact: Lower values suggest better aerodynamics, improving highway efficiency and top speed.                                | Frontal area (width × height) affects air resistance. Heavy, boxy vehicles (high index) consume more fuel at high speeds.                      |
| Torque Estimate          | `(horsepower * 5252) / peak_rpm`                                        | Estimates engine torque (lb-ft): Critical for towing/acceleration, supplementing horsepower for drivability assessment.                    | Torque isn't provided; this standard formula approximates it using peak-RPM horsepower. Trucks/SUVs benefit from high torque.                  |
| Cylinder Efficiency      | `horsepower / num_cylinders`                                            | Power output per cylinder: Highlights engineering efficiency (e.g., turbocharging), affecting maintenance costs and performance.            | High values indicate advanced tech (e.g., 4-cylinders matching V8 power). Low values may imply outdated designs.                              |
| Highway Optimization     | `highway_mpg - city_mpg`                                                | Highway efficiency gain: Larger gaps indicate engines/gearing optimized for cruising, appealing to long-distance buyers.                   | Vehicles with small gaps (e.g., 5 mpg) are city-oriented; large gaps (15+ mpg) suit highway commuters.                                         |
| Safety-Weight Indicator  | `1 if (curb-weight > 2800) and (symboling <= 0) else 0`                 | Flags safe, heavy vehicles: Combines crash-test ratings (symboling ≤ 0) and mass, reducing insurance claims.                               | NHTSA data shows heavier cars with good ratings (low symboling) have lower fatality rates. Critical for insurance pricing.                    |
| Turbo-Diesel Premium     | `1 if (aspiration == 'turbo') and (fuel_type == 'diesel') else 0`       | Flags high-torque diesels: Turbo-diesels command price premiums for fuel efficiency and durability in trucks/SUVs.                          | Diesel turbos improve combustion efficiency (+30% mpg vs gasoline). Market segment for work/towing vehicles.                                   |
| Sports Car Profile       | `1 if (body_style in ['convertible', 'hatchback']) and (drive_wheels == 'rwd') else 0` | Identifies sporty configurations: RWD with agile body styles correlates with enthusiast appeal and price premiums.                     | Sports cars (e.g., Miatas, Corvettes) fit this profile. RWD improves handling dynamics; convertibles/hatchbacks reduce weight.                 |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance & Efficiency**: Features like *Power-to-Weight Ratio*, *Engine Displacement*, and *Cylinder Efficiency* quantify engineering excellence, directly linking to acceleration, fuel economy, and market positioning. These help segment economy vs. luxury/sports models.
- **Real-World Usability**: *Fuel Efficiency Score* and *Highway Optimization* reflect practical ownership costs, appealing to cost-conscious buyers. *Torque Estimate* and *Turbo-Diesel Premium* target utility buyers (towing/hauling).
- **Safety & Design**: *Safety-Weight Indicator* uses industry crash-test data (symboling) to identify low-risk vehicles. *Aerodynamic Index* exposes design trade-offs between interior space and efficiency.
- **Market Segmentation**: *Sports Car Profile* and *Turbo-Diesel Premium* create niches for targeted marketing. These align with known consumer preferences (enthusiasts, commercial users).

Features leverage intrinsic automotive physics (e.g., torque calculation, displacement) and domain trends (e.g., turbo-diesel demand). All formulas use existing columns without external data except *Safety-Weight Indicator*, which references NHTSA crash-test principles.
