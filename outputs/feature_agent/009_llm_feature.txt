|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **power_to_weight**      | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                                                           | Higher ratios indicate better performance, appealing to enthusiasts and affecting price. | Performance cars command premiums; this ratio directly correlates with acceleration and speed.                                                  |
| **displacement_per_cyl** | `engine-size / (num-of-cylinders mapped to numeric: {"two":2, "three":3, ..., "twelve":12})`         | Larger displacement per cylinder suggests advanced engineering or performance focus. | High-end engines (e.g., V8s) have larger displacement/cylinder, linking to luxury/performance segmentation.                                     |
| **combined_mpg**         | `(0.55 * city-mpg) + (0.45 * highway-mpg)`                                                           | Represents real-world fuel efficiency, impacting operating costs and buyer preference. | Fuel costs influence total ownership cost; efficient cars appeal to budget-conscious buyers, while inefficiency may indicate performance.        |
| **interior_volume**      | `length * width * height`                                                                            | Larger volumes offer greater comfort/practicality, increasing desirability. | SUVs/wagons with high volume target families; sports cars minimize volume for agility. Volume correlates with price segmentation.                |
| **bore_stroke_ratio**    | `bore / stroke`                                                                                      | High ratios (>1) indicate high-revving performance engines; low ratios (<1) favor torque. | Sports cars (e.g., Porsche) use over-square designs (ratio >1); this differentiates engine characteristics affecting price.                     |
| **high_compression**     | `1 if compression-ratio >= 10 else 0`                                                                | High compression improves efficiency and power but requires premium fuel, signaling advanced engineering. | Modern performance engines (e.g., turbocharged) use high compression; this binary flag isolates premium tech.                                   |
| **sports_car_flag**      | `1 if (body-style in ["convertible", "hardtop"]) and (drive-wheels == "rwd") and (num-of-cylinders ≥ 6) else 0` | Flags high-performance sports cars, which command price premiums. | Combines body style (convertible/hardtop), drivetrain (RWD), and engine size (≥6 cyl) to target iconic sports cars (e.g., Corvette, BMW).       |
| **turbo_diesel**         | `1 if (aspiration == "turbo") and (fuel-type == "diesel") else 0`                                    | Turbo-diesel engines offer torque and efficiency, appealing for luxury/utility vehicles. | Diesels with turbos (e.g., Mercedes) balance power and fuel economy, targeting a premium niche.                                                |
| **city_fuel_cost**       | `100 / city-mpg`                                                                                     | Directly measures fuel cost per 100 miles in city driving, affecting ownership costs. | High city consumption deters urban buyers; inversely related to efficiency. Better than raw MPG for cost interpretation.                         |
| **stability_factor**     | `wheel-base / width`                                                                                 | Higher ratios improve stability and ride comfort, desirable in luxury/SUV segments. | Long wheelbases (relative to width) enhance handling (e.g., sedans vs. compacts); links to safety and premium positioning.                     |
| **missing_losses**       | `1 if normalized-losses is NaN else 0`                                                               | Missing loss data may indicate new/rare models or data gaps, influencing value perception. | 20% of `normalized-losses` are missing; this flag captures uncertainty in risk assessment.                                                    |
| **brand_country**        | External mapping: e.g., `{"toyota":"Japan", "bmw":"Germany", ...}`                                   | Country of origin affects brand perception (e.g., German = luxury, Japanese = reliability). | External enrichment; country stereotypes influence pricing (e.g., European brands average higher prices).                                        |
| **estimated_torque**     | `(horsepower * 5252) / peak-rpm`                                                                     | Torque measures low-end power (e.g., for towing/acceleration), critical for trucks/performance cars. | Derived from physics; trucks/SUVs with high torque target utility buyers, sports cars target enthusiasts.                                       |
| **awd_flag**             | `1 if drive-wheels == "4wd" else 0`                                                                  | AWD improves traction/safety, adding value in premium or utility segments. | AWD systems increase manufacturing cost and appeal in snowy/off-road markets, justifying price premiums.                                        |
| **mpg_drop**             | `highway-mpg - city-mpg`                                                                             | Larger drops indicate poor city efficiency, highlighting engines unsuited for urban use. | Performance engines suffer more in city driving; efficiency drops may correlate with power-focused designs.                                     |
| **is_rear_engine**       | `1 if engine-location == "rear" else 0`                                                              | Rear-engine layouts (e.g., Porsche 911) are rare and performance-oriented, increasing price. | Only 3 rear-engine cars exist; this flags exclusive, high-performance models.                                                                  |
| **luxury_make_flag**     | `1 if make in ["bmw","mercedes-benz","jaguar","porsche","audi"] else 0`                              | Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, technology, and build quality. | External knowledge; luxury makes (e.g., BMW) average higher prices ($31k) vs. non-luxury ($10k).                                               |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance & Efficiency**: Features like `power_to_weight`, `displacement_per_cyl`, and `estimated_torque` target performance-oriented buyers. Ratios (e.g., `bore_stroke_ratio`) and flags (e.g., `high_compression`) isolate engineering traits linked to speed/efficiency. These directly impact price through desirability and production costs.
- **Practicality & Comfort**: `interior_volume`, `stability_factor`, and `combined_mpg` address daily usability. Larger/more efficient cars appeal to families, while compact designs target urban buyers. Fuel costs (`city_fuel_cost`) quantify ownership expenses.
- **Market Segmentation**: Flags (`sports_car_flag`, `luxury_make_flag`, `awd_flag`) use domain knowledge to isolate high-value segments. External data (`brand_country`) captures cultural perceptions. These features enhance interpretability by aligning with buyer personas.
- **Risk & Exclusivity**: `missing_losses` and `is_rear_engine` leverage rarity/data gaps. High-risk symbols (not engineered due to redundancy) and turbo-diesel combinations target niche markets.

These features combine automotive engineering principles (e.g., torque calculation, compression effects) with market dynamics (luxury branding, AWD demand) to improve price prediction and model interpretability.
