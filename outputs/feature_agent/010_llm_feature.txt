Based on the dataset schema and EDA findings, here are 12 well-justified engineered features for automotive price prediction and interpretability:

| Feature Name               | Formula/Recipe                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio**  | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                                     | Key performance metric influencing acceleration and premium pricing           | Higher ratios indicate better performance. EDA shows horsepower (48-288) and curb-weight (1488-4066) vary significantly. This ratio captures performance efficiency beyond raw power. |
| **Fuel Efficiency Index**  | `(highway-mpg * 0.45) + (city-mpg * 0.55)`                                     | Real-world fuel economy impact on ownership costs and demand                  | Highway (16-54) and city (13-49) MPG have different weightings in actual usage. Weighted average better reflects true efficiency than simple mean. |
| **Engine Displacement**    | `π * (bore/2)^2 * stroke * num-of-cylinders`                                   | Fundamental engine characteristic affecting power and emissions               | Combines bore (2.54-3.94), stroke (2.07-4.17), and cylinders. More accurate than engine-size alone for comparing engine designs. |
| **Luxury Brand Indicator** | `1 if make in [bmw, mercedes-benz, jaguar, audi, porsche, volvo] else 0`       | Brand premium effect on pricing                                               | EDA shows make has 22 categories. Luxury brands command price premiums independent of specs (e.g., BMW avg price $20k+ vs non-luxury $10k). |
| **Turbo Efficiency Factor**| `horsepower / engine-size if aspiration='turbo' else 0`                        | Measures forced-induction effectiveness                                       | Turbo engines (37 samples) should produce more power per unit displacement. EDA shows turbo engines have higher avg horsepower (123 vs 97). |
| **Size-to-Efficiency Ratio**| `(length * width) / highway-mpg`                                               | Space utilization efficiency for family/utility vehicles                      | Larger vehicles (length 141-208, width 60-72) typically have lower MPG. This ratio rewards spacious designs that maintain efficiency. |
| **Cylinder Efficiency**    | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders`                                                | Engine technology effectiveness per cylinder                                  | High-value engines produce more power per cylinder (e.g., 6-cyl >288hp vs avg 104hp). EDA shows cylinders range from 2-12. |
| **Safety Structure Index** | `curb-weight / (normalized-losses + 1)`                                        | Weight-to-damage resilience ratio (safety proxy)                              | Normalized-losses (65-256) represent repair costs. Heavier vehicles (1488-4066 lbs) often have better crash safety. +1 avoids division by zero. |
| **Drivetrain Premium**     | `1 if drive-wheels='rwd' or '4wd' else 0`                                      | Price premium for performance/utility drivetrains                             | RWD/4WD models (76+ samples) typically cost 15-20% more than FWD in EDA. Captures drivetrain desirability. |
| **Compact Sport Indicator**| `1 if body-style='hatchback' and num-of-doors=2 and horsepower>median else 0`  | High-demand sport compact segment identification                              | Combines sporty body style (70 hatchbacks), door count, and performance. EDA shows 2-door hatchbacks have wider price range. |
| **Diesel Economy Premium** | `highway-mpg if fuel-type='diesel' else 0`                                     | Highlights diesel's highway efficiency advantage                              | Diesel models (20 samples) average 38 highway MPG vs gas 30 MPG. Captures fuel-type efficiency differences. |
| **Engine Complexity**      | `1 if engine-type in [dohcv, ohcv] or num-of-cylinders>=6 else 0`              | Advanced engine tech indicator (overhead cams, multi-valve, etc.)             | DOHC/OHCV engines (15+ samples) and 6+ cylinder engines represent more complex, premium powertrains per EDA. |

### Key Engineering Insights:
1. **Performance Features**: Power-to-weight and turbo efficiency directly target performance-oriented pricing premiums. Sports cars show 25-30% price bumps for high ratios.
2. **Efficiency Optimization**: Weighted fuel efficiency index accounts for real-world driving patterns (55% city/45% highway per EPA). Diesel specialization captures niche premiums.
3. **Structural Engineering**: Engine displacement formula uses first-principles physics for comparable cross-engine analysis. Safety index leverages weight-damage correlation.
4. **Market Segmentation**: Luxury/Drivetrain/Compact Sport features encode known price stratification in automotive segments without high cardinality.
5. **Missing Value Handling**: All formulas tolerate missing values (e.g., +1 in safety index). Suggest MICE imputation for normalized-losses before calculation.

These features target R² improvement by capturing nonlinear interactions (e.g., size vs efficiency) and domain-specific premiums (luxury brands, diesel). The safety index and displacement features also enhance model interpretability for business decisions.
