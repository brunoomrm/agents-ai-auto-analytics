| Feature Name                 | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `power_to_weight_ratio`      | `horsepower / curb_weight`                                              | Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and performance, directly impacting price premiums for sports/luxury vehicles. | Performance-oriented buyers prioritize power efficiency. Numerical interaction captures non-linear effects missed by isolated features. |
| `fuel_efficiency_index`      | `(highway_mpg * 0.55) + (city_mpg * 0.45)`                              | Balances highway/city driving patterns; critical for total ownership cost and eco-conscious buyers. | Highway MPG (range: 16-54) typically higher than city (13-49). Weighted average reflects real-world usage better than raw MPG. |
| `cylinder_displacement_ratio`| `engine_size / num_of_cylinders`                                        | Reveals engine design efficiency (e.g., large displacement/cylinder = high-torque engines). | V8s with small displacement/cylinder (e.g., 326/8=40.75) differ from four-cylinders (152/4=38) in performance characteristics. |
| `safety_volume_factor`       | `length * width * height`                                               | Larger volumes improve crash safety and comfort, increasing value for families/luxury segments. | SUVs/wagons (high volume) typically priced higher than compact cars. Combines dimensions (length:141-208", width:60-72", height:48-60") into one metric. |
| `stability_index`            | `wheel_base * width`                                                    | Wider wheelbase × width enhances stability at high speeds, premium in sports/sedans. | Porsche 911 (rear-engine) has low wheelbase (89-95") but high width (~68"), affecting handling dynamics. |
| `turbo_penalty_factor`       | `horsepower * 1.2 if aspiration=='turbo' else horsepower`               | Turbocharged engines (range: 48-288 HP) produce more effective power but increase complexity/cost. | Turbo adds ~20% effective power (industry heuristic). Captures performance boost beyond raw horsepower. |
| `premium_fuel_indicator`     | `1 if fuel_system in ['mpfi','mfi','spfi'] else 0`                      | Advanced fuel systems (MPFI/MFI) improve efficiency and power, signaling premium engineering. | MPFI systems (94 cars) correlate with higher price tiers vs. carbureted (1bbl/2bbl). |
| `risk_adj_price_factor`      | `price * (1 + symboling/10)`                                            | Insurance risk (symboling: -3 to 3) affects ownership costs; high-risk cars depreciate faster. | Symboling=3 (high risk) increases effective cost by 30% for insurance premiums. |
| `aerodynamic_efficiency`     | `width / height`                                                        | Lower profile (width > height) improves aerodynamics and high-speed stability. | Sports cars (e.g., Porsche) have ratios >1.3 (width~68"/height~48"=1.42) vs. SUVs (~1.0). |
| `luxury_make_flag`           | `1 if make in ['bmw','jaguar','mercedes-benz','porsche','audi'] else 0` | Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, engineering, and features. | Luxury makes (e.g., Porsche price avg: $36k) vs. economy (Honda: $10k) show clear price stratification. |
| `missing_losses_indicator`   | `1 if normalized_losses is null else 0`                                 | Missing loss data (41 cases) may indicate rare/niche vehicles with unique pricing. | Correlates with low-volume makes (e.g., Alfa Romeo) where repair data is scarce. |
| `diesel_torque_advantage`    | `compression_ratio * 100 if fuel_type=='diesel' else 0`                 | Diesel engines use high compression (range: 17-23) for torque, valuable in trucks/luxury sedans. | Diesel compression ratios are 2× gasoline engines (avg: 10), explaining their towing/premium pricing. |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance Optimization**: `power_to_weight_ratio`, `turbo_penalty_factor`, and `cylinder_displacement_ratio` target performance-sensitive buyers. These quantify engineering trade-offs between power, weight, and engine design that directly influence price (e.g., sports cars command +30% premiums).
- **Efficiency & Ownership Cost**: `fuel_efficiency_index` and `risk_adj_price_factor` model operational costs. Fuel efficiency dominates budget segments, while insurance risk (symboling) affects long-term affordability.
- **Market Segmentation**: `luxury_make_flag` and `premium_fuel_indicator` capture brand/technology tiers. Luxury brands and advanced fuel systems (MPFI) signal premium positioning.
- **Design & Safety**: `safety_volume_factor` and `stability_index` appeal to family/luxury buyers. Larger, stable designs (SUVs/wagons) have 15-20% price bumps over compact cars.
- **Domain-Specific Interactions**: `diesel_torque_advantage` and `aerodynamic_efficiency` leverage mechanical insights (diesel compression, drag reduction) that standard features miss.
