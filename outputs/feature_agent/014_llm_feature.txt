This ratio directly links engine output to vehicle mass, a key performance metric in automotive engineering.             |
| `fuel_efficiency_index`    | `(highway-mpg * 0.45) + (city-mpg * 0.55)`                              | Represents real-world fuel economy; critical for operating cost calculations. | EPA uses similar weighted averages. Efficiency significantly impacts total ownership cost, influencing price sensitivity for budget-conscious buyers.                         |
| `cylinder_power_density`  | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders`                                         | Indicates engine sophistication; high density suggests advanced engineering. | Luxury/sports cars optimize power per cylinder (e.g., BMW M-series). Higher values correlate with premium pricing and performance segmentation.                               |
| `safety_risk_score`        | `symboling + (normalized-losses / 100)`                                 | Combines crash test ratings and repair costs; proxies safety/insurance costs. | Negative symboling = safer.

| `luxury_volume_index`      | `(length * width * height) / curb-weight`                               | Measures spaciousness relative to weight; luxury vehicles optimize this.      | Luxury brands (e.g., Mercedes) maximize cabin space while maintaining weight for noise isolation. High values indicate premium interior design affecting price.               |
| `engine_stress_factor`     | `horsepower / (bore * stroke)`                                          | High values indicate forced induction or advanced combustion; proxies tech level. | Modern performance engines achieve high power with smaller displacements (e.g., turbocharging). This signals engineering R&D costs reflected in price.                      |
| `high_risk_insurance_tier` | `1 if (symboling >= 1) or (normalized-losses > 150) else 0`             | Identifies vehicles with elevated insurance costs.                            | Symboling ≥1 and losses >150 (75th percentile) indicate poor safety/repairability. Directly impacts total ownership cost – a key purchase factor.                          |
| `premium_body_style`       | `1 if body-style in ['convertible', 'hardtop'] else 0`                  | Flags exclusive body styles with price premiums.                              | Convertibles/hardtops have complex engineering and niche appeal (e.g., BMW 4-series vs. 3-series). Strongly correlates with luxury segmentation.                            |
| `displacement_volume`      | `π * (bore/2)^2 * stroke * num-of-cylinders`                            | Calculates true engine displacement; fundamental performance metric.          | More accurate than `engine-size` (which may include non-displacement factors). Directly correlates with power potential and regulatory fees (e.g., gas-guzzler tax).         |
| `rwd_performance_flag`     | `1 if (drive-wheels == 'rwd') and (engine-location == 'front') else 0`  | Identifies performance-oriented drivetrains.                                  | RWD/front-engine layouts (e.g., BMW) optimize weight distribution for handling. Targeted by enthusiasts willing to pay premiums for driving dynamics.                      |
| `fuel_system_efficiency`   | `1 if fuel-system in ['mpfi', 'spfi'] else 0`                           | Flags modern fuel injection systems for efficiency/power.                     | MPFI/SPFI systems offer better atomization than carburetors (1bbl/2bbl). Affects emissions compliance and performance – critical for regulatory and buyer preferences.     |
| `highway_cruise_efficiency`| `highway-mpg / city-mpg`                                                | Measures efficiency bias toward highway driving.                              | Values >1 indicate highway-optimized gearing/aero. Relevant for buyers with long commutes. SUVs/trucks often have lower ratios due to aerodynamics.                        |
| `missing_losses_indicator` | `1 if normalized-losses is null else 0`                                 | Flags vehicles with unreported damage; may indicate data gaps or new models.  | 20% of losses data is missing. Could correlate with rare/niche vehicles where repair data is scarce, affecting price uncertainty.                                           |
| `cylinder_class`           | `'high' if num-of-cylinders >= 6 else 'low'`                            | Simplifies cylinder segmentation for market positioning.                      | >6 cylinders typically indicate premium/performance models (mean=4.4). Reduces dimensionality while capturing key performance tiers.                                       |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance & Efficiency:** `power_to_weight_ratio`, `cylinder_power_density`, and `engine_stress_factor` target performance-oriented buyers. These quantify engineering sophistication that commands price premiums (e.g., sports/luxury segments).  
- **Cost of Ownership:** `fuel_efficiency_index`, `safety_risk_score`, and `high_risk_insurance_tier` model operational expenses. Budget-conscious buyers prioritize these, affecting demand curves for economy vehicles.  
- **Market Segmentation:** `premium_body_style`, `turbo_diesel_flag`, and `cylinder_class` identify niche segments (luxury, performance, efficiency-focused) with distinct pricing strategies.  
- **Domain-Specific Engineering:** `displacement_volume` and `aerodynamic_efficiency` incorporate automotive physics principles that directly influence vehicle capabilities and regulatory costs.  
- **Data Quality:** `missing_losses_indicator` addresses data gaps that could bias pricing models, improving robustness.  

Features leverage intrinsic column interactions (e.g., bore/stroke for engine metrics) and realistic external logic (EPA weighting for MPG). They balance interpretability for business decisions (e.g., insurance risk tiers) and predictive power through nonlinear relationships.
