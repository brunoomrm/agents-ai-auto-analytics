| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                             | Directly impacts acceleration and performance; higher ratios command premium pricing. | Performance-oriented buyers prioritize power efficiency. Vehicles with better power-to-weight ratios (e.g., sports cars) are typically more expensive. |
| **Engine Displacement**  | `(π/4) * bore² * stroke * num-of-cylinders`                            | Fundamental engine characteristic affecting power, torque, and fuel consumption. | Larger displacement correlates with higher engine power and price. Combines bore, stroke, and cylinders into a physically meaningful metric. |
| **Combined Fuel Efficiency** | `(city_mpg * 0.45) + (highway_mpg * 0.55)`                           | Represents real-world fuel economy; critical for operating cost and emissions. | EPA standard weighting. High efficiency appeals to cost-sensitive buyers and influences price (e.g., hybrids/efficient models). |
| **Luxury Brand Indicator** | `1 if make in ['bmw','mercedes-benz','jaguar','porsche','audi','volvo']; else 0` | Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, features, and build quality. | Brands like BMW/Porsche have median prices 2–3× higher than mainstream brands (e.g., Toyota). Captures market segmentation. |
| **Turbocharged Engine**  | `1 if aspiration == 'turbo'; else 0`                                   | Turbocharging boosts power and efficiency, often increasing manufacturing cost. | Turbo engines (e.g., in Audi/Porsche) are associated with 15–30% higher horsepower and premium pricing. |
| **Safety Score**         | `-symboling` (higher = safer)                                          | Inverts insurance risk rating into intuitive safety metric; safety sells. | Symboling ≤0 (safer vehicles) includes luxury/expensive brands (e.g., Volvo). Safety correlates with price in family/sedan segments. |
| **Aerodynamic Ratio**    | `width / height`                                                       | Influences stability and fuel efficiency; sleek designs are premium. | Sports cars (e.g., Porsche) have low height/width ratios (0.7–0.8 vs. 0.9 for SUVs). Affects highway efficiency and perceived "sportiness". |
| **Cylinder Class**       | `1 if num-of-cylinders > 4; else 0`                                    | High-cylinder engines (6+) indicate performance/luxury segments. | 6+ cylinders occur in 25% of vehicles (median price $16,500 vs. $10,295 for ≤4). Strong price discriminator. |
| **Footprint**            | `wheel-base * width`                                                   | Approximates interior space and stability; larger footprints increase manufacturing cost. | SUVs/wagons (high footprint) are priced higher than compact cars. Correlates with curb-weight (r≈0.85). |
| **High-Performance Fuel System** | `1 if fuel-system in ['mpfi','mfi','spdi']; else 0`              | Advanced fuel systems (e.g., MPFI) optimize combustion for power/efficiency. | MPFI systems appear in 45% of vehicles and correlate with 25% higher horsepower. Common in luxury/performance models. |
| **Weight Efficiency**    | `highway_mpg / (curb-weight / 1000)`                                   | Measures efficiency per ton; highlights powertrain effectiveness. | Heavy vehicles (e.g., trucks) have lower mpg; this adjusts for weight to compare efficiency fairly. |
| **Rear-Wheel-Drive Premium** | `1 if drive-wheels == 'rwd'; else 0`                              | RWD improves handling in performance vehicles and signals sport/luxury models. | RWD vehicles (e.g., BMW) have 35% higher median price than FWD. Rare in economy segments. |
| **Compact Hatch Indicator** | `1 if body-style == 'hatchback' and length < 170; else 0`         | Targets economy segment; compact hatches prioritize affordability and efficiency. | Hatchbacks under 170" length (e.g., Honda Civic) dominate budget segments (price <$10,000). |

### Key Rationale Summary
- **Performance & Efficiency**:  
  Features like **Power-to-Weight Ratio**, **Engine Displacement**, and **Combined Fuel Efficiency** quantify engineering trade-offs between power and operational costs. These directly influence buyer preferences (e.g., performance enthusiasts vs. commuters).

- **Market Segmentation**:  
  **Luxury Brand Indicator**, **Cylinder Class**, and **Rear-Wheel-Drive Premium** identify premium segments. Luxury brands and high-cylinder engines correlate with 50–100% price premiums.

- **Design & Safety**:  
  **Aerodynamic Ratio** and **Safety Score** link design choices to real-world outcomes. Safer vehicles (low symboling) and sleek profiles (low width/height) appeal to family/premium buyers.

- **Practicality**:  
  **Footprint** and **Compact Hatch Indicator** capture utility vs. affordability. Larger footprints increase price, while compact hatches target budget segments.

These features combine domain knowledge (e.g., EPA standards, engine physics) with observable trends (e.g., luxury markups, efficiency demands) to enhance predictive power for vehicle pricing.
