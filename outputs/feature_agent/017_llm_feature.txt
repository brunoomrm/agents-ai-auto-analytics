| **power_to_weight_ratio**   | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                             | Performance indicator: Higher ratios improve acceleration and top speed.      | Directly links engine output to vehicle mass. Sports cars have high ratios (e.g., Porsche). Correlates with price and desirability.                                         |
| **engine_efficiency**       | `(bore^2 * stroke * num_cylinders_numeric) / engine-size`              | Engine design efficiency: Measures displacement accuracy vs. advertised size. | Discrepancy found in sample data (computed 101.44 vs. 130 engine-size). Reveals engineering precision, affecting performance and value.                                    |
| **combined_mpg**            | `(0.55 * city_mpg) + (0.45 * highway_mpg)`                             | Real-world fuel efficiency: Weighted average reflects typical usage.          | EPA standard for fuel economy estimates. Critical for operating costs and eco-conscious buyers (e.g., hybrids vs. trucks).                                                 |
| **stability_factor**        | `wheel-base / (height * width)`                                        | Handling/safety: Lower center of gravity improves cornering and rollover risk. | Wider wheel-base and lower height enhance stability (e.g., sports cars: 94.5 wheel-base vs. 52.4 height). Safety impacts insurance risk (symboling).                      |
| **turbo_penalty_mpg**       | `city_mpg - (10 * is_turbo)`<br>`is_turbo = 1 if aspiration='turbo' else 0` | Turbo trade-off: Boosts power but reduces fuel economy in city driving.       | Turbos increase horsepower (sample: 111→154) but lower city-mpg (21→19). Explains efficiency compromises for performance.                                                |
| **luxury_indicator**        | `1 if make in ['jaguar','bmw','mercedes-benz','audi','porsche'] else 0` | Market segmentation: Luxury brands command price premiums.                    | External enrichment: High-end brands (e.g., Porsche price=$45.4k max) vs. economy (Honda). Drives price stratification and consumer preferences.                          |
| **footprint_area**          | `length * width`                                                       | Size classification: Regulatory and parking/practicality considerations.      | Larger footprints (e.g., 168.8*64.1=10,816) correlate with curb-weight (2,548) and price. Used in emissions regulations.                                                  |
| **cylinder_impact**         | Map `num-of-cylinders` to numeric:<br>`{'two':2, 'three':3, 'four':4, 'five':5, 'six':6, 'eight':8, 'twelve':12}` | Engine capability: More cylinders enable higher power and smoothness.         | Critical for performance (V8/V12 vs. I4). Sample: 6 cylinders → 152 engine-size. Converts categorical to usable numeric.                                                  |
| **high_compression**        | `1 if compression-ratio > 10 else 0`                                   | Engine performance: High compression enables better efficiency and power.     | Compression >10 (max=23) indicates advanced design. Linked to premium fuel requirements and performance (horsepower↑).                                                    |
| **missing_risk_indicator**  | `1 if normalized-losses is null else 0`                                | Data quality proxy: Missing values may indicate older/obscure models.         | 20% missing (41 rows). These cars may have higher risk (symboling=-3 to 3) or be niche models, affecting price accuracy if ignored.                                       |
| **rwd_premium**             | `1 if drive-wheels='rwd' else 0`                                       | Performance/luxury: RWD improves handling and is common in sports/luxury cars. | RWD in 76/205 rows (e.g., BMW). Associated with higher price (sample: RWD Alfas=$16.5k vs. FWD economy cars).                                                             |
| **stroke_bore_ratio**       | `stroke / bore`                                                        | Engine characteristics: Ratio affects torque, efficiency, and engine sound.   | Values >1 (under-square) favor torque; <1 (over-square) favor RPM. Design choice impacting driving experience (e.g., trucks vs. race cars).                                |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance**: Features like `power_to_weight_ratio`, `turbo_penalty_mpg`, and `rwd_premium` directly link to speed/handling. High-performance cars command price premiums (e.g., turbo RWD Porsche).
- **Efficiency**: `combined_mpg` and `high_compression` quantify fuel economy trade-offs. Critical for budget-conscious buyers and regulatory compliance (e.g., EPA ratings).
- **Market Segmentation**: `luxury_indicator` and `cylinder_impact` reflect brand/reputation tiers and engine capabilities. Luxury/sports cars (BMW V8) vs. economy models (Honda I4).
- **Safety/Stability**: `stability_factor` uses wheel-base/width/height to infer rollover risk and handling—key for insurance (symboling) and family vehicles.
- **Data Quality**: `missing_risk_indicator` addresses schema gaps (20% missing normalized-losses), preventing biased predictions for rare models.
- **Domain-Specific Engineering**: `engine_efficiency` and `stroke_bore_ratio` leverage mechanical relationships (bore/stroke/displacement) to reveal engineering nuances affecting value.
