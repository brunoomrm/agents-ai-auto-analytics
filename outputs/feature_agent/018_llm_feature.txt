Based on the dataset schema and EDA findings, here are 12 well-justified engineered features for automotive price prediction and business insights:

| Feature Name | Formula/Recipe | Justification | Reasoning Chain |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight` | Direct performance indicator influencing price premium | Higher ratios correlate with sports/luxury vehicles. EDA shows horsepower (48-288) and curb-weight (1488-4066) vary significantly. This ratio quantifies performance efficiency. |
| **Displacement Volume** | `Ï€ * (bore/2)^2 * stroke * num-of-cylinders` | Fundamental engine size metric affecting performance | Combines bore (2.54-3.94), stroke (2.07-4.17), and cylinders. Missing bore/stroke (4 NAs) require imputation. Larger displacement typically increases manufacturing cost and price. |
| **Fuel Efficiency Index** | `(highway-mpg * 0.7) + (city-mpg * 0.3)` | Weighted efficiency metric for real-world value | Highway-mpg (16-54) and city-mpg (13-49) show moderate skew (0.54-0.66). 70/30 weighting reflects typical driving patterns. Critical for eco-conscious buyers. |
| **Luxury Brand Indicator** | `1 if make in [bmw, mercedes-benz, jaguar, audi, porsche] else 0` | Captures brand premium effect | Make distribution shows Toyota (32) dominates volume, while luxury brands have fewer units. EDA price max (45.4k) suggests luxury presence. |
| **Aerodynamic Ratio** | `width / height` | Stability and design efficiency proxy | Width (60.3-72.3) and height (47.8-59.8) have low skew (0.90/0.06). Lower ratios indicate sportier profiles (e.g., convertibles) that command premiums. |
| **Turbo Premium** | `horsepower * 1.3 if aspiration=='turbo' else horsepower` | Values forced induction performance boost | Turbo vehicles (37/205) show higher avg. horsepower. Industry knowledge: turbos increase power density by ~30%. Captures engineering premium. |
| **Cylinder Efficiency** | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders` | Measures engine technological sophistication | Num-of-cylinders ranges 2-12. High values indicate advanced engineering (e.g., BMW 6-cyl). EDA shows horsepower skew (1.39) suggests performance outliers. |
| **Safety Composite** | `(curb-weight / 1000) - symboling` | Combines crash protection metrics | Symboling (-3 to 3) measures risk, curb-weight (1488-4066) contributes to safety. Heavier, lower-risk vehicles (min -3) appeal to family buyers. |
| **Space Utilization** | `(length * width * height) / wheel-base` | Interior volume efficiency indicator | Wheel-base (86.6-120.9) and dimensions vary. Higher values indicate better packaging (e.g., minivans), a key family vehicle selling point. |
| **Premium Fuel Tax** | `engine-size * 1.5 if fuel-type=='diesel' else 0` | Accounts for diesel engine surcharge | Diesel vehicles (20/205) typically cost $1.5 more per engine-size unit. Justified by manufacturing complexity and emission systems. |
| **Drivetrain Factor** | `curb-weight * 1.1 if drive-wheels=='4wd' else curb-weight` | Quantifies AWD/4WD weight penalty | 4WD systems add ~10% weight. Drive-wheels distribution (fwd:120, rwd:76, 4wd:9) shows niche presence. Critical for off-road pricing. |
| **High-Rev Premium** | `horsepower * (peak-rpm / 5000)` | Values high-RPM performance engines | Peak-rpm (4150-6600) with mean 5125. High-revving engines (e.g., >5500 RPM) require advanced materials, increasing cost. |

**Key Engineering Insights:**
1. **Performance Dominance:** 6/12 features relate to power/performance, aligning with EDA's horsepower skew (1.39) and wide engine-size range (61-326)
2. **Missing Value Strategy:** Features using bore/stroke (4 NAs) or horsepower (2 NAs) require median imputation
3. **Categorical Leverage:** Interaction terms (turbo, drivetrain, fuel) extract numerical value from categoricals
4. **Business Alignment:** Combines engineering metrics (displacement) with consumer priorities (safety, luxury, efficiency)
5. **Non-Linear Capture:** Ratios and interactions mitigate linear assumption risks in modeling

These features address predictive gaps by quantifying: performance efficiency (Power-to-Weight), manufacturing complexity (Displacement), brand effects (Luxury Indicator), and technology premiums (Turbo, High-Rev).
