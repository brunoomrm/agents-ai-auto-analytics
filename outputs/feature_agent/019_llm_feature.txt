### Engineered Feature Suggestions

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **power_to_weight**      | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and performance, influencing price and desirability. | Performance is a key factor in automotive pricing. Combining engine output (horsepower) with vehicle mass (curb-weight) creates a direct performance metric. |
| **displacement_per_cylinder** | `engine_size / (num_of_cylinders mapped to integer: {"two":2, "three":3, "four":4, "five":5, "six":6, "eight":8, "twelve":12})` | Reveals engine design efficiency. Larger displacement per cylinder often correlates with higher torque and performance. | Engine size alone doesn't account for cylinder count. This ratio helps distinguish between high-efficiency small-bore engines and torque-focused designs. |
| **combined_mpg**         | `(2 * city_mpg * highway_mpg) / (city_mpg + highway_mpg)` (harmonic mean) | Represents real-world fuel efficiency, a critical factor for operating costs and consumer preference. | EPA uses harmonic mean for fuel economy. Better than arithmetic mean as it accounts for distance/volume relationships. |
| **interior_volume**      | `length * width * height`                                               | Larger volumes increase practicality and comfort, directly affecting vehicle segmentation (e.g., family vs. sports cars). | Physical dimensions interact multiplicatively. SUVs/wagons prioritize this, while sports cars minimize it. |
| **footprint**            | `wheel_base * track_width` (using `width` as proxy for track width)     | Regulatory metric influencing safety/efficiency standards. Larger footprints improve stability. | Used in CAFE standards. Connects wheelbase (stability) and width (interior space). |
| **bore_stroke_ratio**    | `bore / stroke`                                                         | >1 indicates high-RPM performance engines; <1 suggests torque-oriented designs. Key for engine characterization. | Oversquare engines (e.g., sports cars) favor horsepower; undersquare (e.g., trucks) favor torque. |
| **is_luxury_make**       | `1 if make in ['bmw','mercedes-benz','jaguar','porsche','audi','volvo','saab'] else 0` | Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, features, and build quality. | EDA shows luxury brands (e.g., Porsche: avg price $30k+) vs. economy (e.g., Honda: avg ~$10k). External brand tier knowledge applied. |
| **is_rear_engine_rwd**   | `1 if (engine_location == 'rear' and drive_wheels == 'rwd') else 0`     | Rare configuration (e.g., Porsche 911) associated with high performance and premium pricing. | Only 3 rear-engine cars in data. This flags unique engineering affecting price/performance. |
| **high_compression**     | `1 if compression_ratio > 10 else 0`                                    | High compression improves efficiency and power but requires premium fuel, increasing ownership costs. | Compression ratios >10 (max=23) indicate performance-oriented engines. Skewed distribution justifies binary split. |
| **mpg_ratio**            | `highway_mpg / city_mpg`                                                | Measures highway efficiency bias. Values >1.3 suggest optimized cruising, appealing to commuters. | Reveals design focus (e.g., sports cars have smaller ratios due to aerodynamic compromises). |
| **estimated_torque**     | `(horsepower * 5252) / peak_rpm`                                        | Torque determines drivability and towing capacity. Critical where horsepower alone is insufficient. | Derived from mechanical relationship (HP = Torque Ã— RPM / 5252). Fills data gap for torque values. |
| **torque_to_weight**     | `estimated_torque / curb_weight`                                        | Key for low-end acceleration and towing capability, especially for trucks/SUVs. | Complements power_to_weight by emphasizing low-RPM performance. |
| **is_mpfi**              | `1 if fuel_system == 'mpfi' else 0`                                     | MPFI systems improve fuel efficiency and emissions, signaling modern engineering. | MPFI is the most common advanced system (94/205 rows), associated with higher efficiency. |
| **sports_car_indicator** | `1 if (body_style in ['convertible','hatchback'] and num_of_doors==2 and power_to_weight > 0.08) else 0` | Flags high-performance sports cars, which command price premiums. | Combines body style (convertible/2-door), door count, and performance threshold (0.08 HP/lb is performance benchmark). |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance Metrics** (`power_to_weight`, `torque_to_weight`, `bore_stroke_ratio`): Directly linked to acceleration, towing, and driving dynamics. High values correlate with premium pricing (e.g., sports cars).
- **Efficiency Features** (`combined_mpg`, `mpg_ratio`, `is_mpfi`): Address fuel costs and emissions regulations. Critical for economy segments (e.g., `mpg_ratio` exposes highway-optimized models).
- **Market Segmentation** (`is_luxury_make`, `sports_car_indicator`, `is_rear_engine_rwd`): Encode brand prestige and vehicle purpose. Luxury/performance flags explain price outliers (e.g., Porsche vs. Toyota).
- **Engineering Insights** (`displacement_per_cylinder`, `high_compression`): Reveal engine design choices. High compression or large displacement/cylinder indicate performance engineering.
- **Physical Properties** (`interior_volume`, `footprint`): Define usability and regulatory class. Large volumes target families; footprints influence safety ratings.

Features leverage interactions (e.g., `sports_car_indicator` combines body style, doors, and power) and domain knowledge (e.g., torque estimation formula). External enrichment (`is_luxury_make`) uses established brand classifications.
