### Engineered Feature Suggestions

| Feature Name             | Formula                                                                 | Justification                                                                 | Reasoning Chain                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **power_to_weight_ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                              | Higher ratios indicate better performance and acceleration, directly influencing desirability and price. | Performance-oriented buyers prioritize power efficiency. Combining engine output (horsepower) with vehicle mass (curb-weight) creates a standard industry metric for performance. |
| **bore_stroke_ratio**     | `bore / stroke`                                                         | Determines engine character: >1 (oversquare) favors high-RPM power, <1 (undersquare) favors torque. Affects driving experience and price. | Engine design impacts performance. Oversquare engines (e.g., sports cars) command premiums. Bore/stroke ratio captures this design trade-off where bore ∈ [2.54, 3.94] and stroke ∈ [2.07, 4.17]. |
| **avg_fuel_efficiency**   | `(city_mpg + highway_mpg) / 2`                                          | Represents real-world fuel economy. Higher efficiency reduces ownership costs, increasing market appeal. | Buyers consider fuel costs. Averaging city (13–49 MPG) and highway (16–54 MPG) efficiency provides a practical estimate of overall economy. |
| **mpg_difference**        | `highway_mpg - city_mpg`                                                | Larger gaps indicate highway-optimized designs (e.g., aerodynamics, gearing), appealing for long-distance buyers. | Highway MPG is typically higher than city MPG. A significant gap (e.g., >10 MPG) signals aerodynamic or transmission advantages, correlating with premium models. |
| **luxury_brand**          | `1 if make in ['jaguar','bmw','mercedes-benz','porsche','audi','volvo']; else 0` | Luxury brands command price premiums due to prestige, build quality, and technology. | Brands like Porsche (max price $45.4K) and Jaguar have higher median prices than mass-market brands (e.g., Toyota). This binary feature isolates the luxury segment. |
| **turbo_diesel**          | `1 if (aspiration == 'turbo') and (fuel_type == 'diesel'); else 0`      | Turbo-diesel engines offer superior torque and efficiency, typical in premium or heavy-duty vehicles. | Turbocharging enhances diesel efficiency. This combo is rare (only 2% of data) but correlates with high-torque applications (e.g., SUVs), influencing price. |
| **sports_car**            | `1 if (body_style in ['convertible','hatchback']) and (num_of_doors == 2); else 0` | Sports cars (e.g., two-door convertibles) target performance enthusiasts, commanding price premiums. | Vehicles like the Porsche 911 (body_style: convertible) have high prices. Combining body style and doors isolates sporty models with distinct pricing dynamics. |
| **estimated_torque**      | `(horsepower * 5252) / peak_rpm`                                        | Torque measures low-RPM pulling power, critical for acceleration/towing. Missing in data but derivable. | Horsepower and peak RPM (4150–6600) allow torque estimation via standard formula. High torque improves drivability, especially for trucks/SUVs. |
| **vehicle_volume**        | `length * width * height`                                               | Larger volumes increase cargo/passenger space, enhancing practicality for families/utility buyers. | Dimensions (length:141–208", width:60–72", height:48–60") define interior space. SUVs/wagons (e.g., Volvo) leverage this for higher price points. |
| **footprint**             | `wheel_base * width`                                                    | Larger footprints improve stability and ride comfort, signaling upscale vehicles. | Wheelbase (86–121") and width correlate with vehicle class. Luxury sedans (long wheelbase) and SUVs (wide track) use this for market positioning. |
| **safety_risk**           | `log(normalized_losses + 1)`                                            | Log-transform reduces skew in insurance loss data (range 65–256). Higher losses indicate poor safety, lowering resale value. | Normalized-losses has high skew (0.77) and 20% missing. Log transform normalizes the distribution, improving model handling of safety-related depreciation. |
| **engine_efficiency**     | `horsepower / engine_size`                                              | Measures power output per unit displacement. Higher ratios signal advanced engineering (e.g., turbocharging). | Engine size (61–326) and horsepower (48–288) vary. High ratios (e.g., Porsche’s 3.5) indicate performance engineering, justifying price premiums. |

### Summary of Key Rationales
- **Performance & Efficiency**: Features like `power_to_weight_ratio`, `engine_efficiency`, and `avg_fuel_efficiency` directly link to driving dynamics and operating costs—critical factors in pricing. Torque estimation bridges a data gap for performance modeling.
- **Market Segmentation**: `luxury_brand` and `sports_car` isolate high-value segments, while `turbo_diesel` targets a niche with engineering prestige. These align with brand-based pricing strategies.
- **Design & Practicality**: `vehicle_volume` and `footprint` quantify size/utility, explaining price differences between compact cars and SUVs. `bore_stroke_ratio` captures hidden engineering trade-offs.
- **Safety & Risk**: `safety_risk` transforms skewed insurance data into a normalized feature, addressing depreciation effects from crash performance.
- **Highway Optimization**: `mpg_difference` identifies models with aerodynamic/gearing advantages, appealing to cost-conscious buyers.

These features combine domain knowledge (e.g., engine design, market segments) with statistical insights (skew correction, interaction effects) to enhance predictive power and model interpretability.
