    "|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Power-to-Weight Ratio** | `horsepower / curb-weight`                                             | Critical performance metric: Higher ratios indicate better acceleration and handling, directly influencing price and desirability.           | EDA shows strong correlation between horsepower and price. Combining with curb-weight (key efficiency/performance factor) quantifies dynamic performance beyond raw power. |\n",
    "| **Fuel Efficiency Gap**   | `highway-mpg - city-mpg`                                               | Highlights drivetrain optimization: Larger gaps indicate engines optimized for highway cruising (e.g., diesels), affecting buyer preferences. | EDA reveals diesel engines (high compression) behave differently. This feature captures efficiency adaptability across driving conditions.                               |\n",
    "| **Cylinder Efficiency**   | `horsepower / num-of-cylinders`                                        | Measures engineering sophistication: High values indicate advanced tech (e.g., turbocharging), justifying price premiums.                    | Turbocharged engines (aspiration=turbo) show higher horsepower. Normalizing by cylinders isolates engineering efficiency from sheer size.                              |\n",
    "| **Size Index**            | `(length * width * height) / 1000`                                     | Represents interior volume and stability: Larger vehicles command higher prices and influence safety perceptions.                            | Strong correlation between dimensions/weight in EDA. This aggregate metric better captures spatial utility than individual dimensions.                                  |\n",
    "| **High-Risk Safety Flag** | `1 if normalized-losses > 200 else 0`                                  | Identifies safety outliers for insurance/risk models: Vehicles with losses >200 are actuarially high-risk.                                   | EDA flags normalized-losses >200 as extreme values. This binary feature isolates high-risk vehicles for targeted analysis.                                              |\n",
    "| **Performance Engine Flag**| `1 if (aspiration = 'turbo') and (horsepower > 150) else 0`            | Tags high-performance configurations: Turbocharged engines with >150HP are premium segments affecting price and insurance.                   | EDA notes turbo linkage to higher horsepower. Combining both isolates true performance models (e.g., sports cars).                                                    |\n",
    "| **Diesel Compression Flag**| `1 if (compression-ratio > 15) or (fuel-type = 'diesel') else 0`       | Flags diesel/high-efficiency engines: High compression ratios (â‰¥15) define distinct efficiency/performance characteristics.                 | Anomaly at compression-ratio=23 (diesel trait). This feature groups diesel-specific engineering for better modeling.                                                  |\n",

This ratio captures design trade-offs affecting driver experience and safety.                                                  |\n",

    "| **Safety Rating**     | NHTSA/IIHS crash-test scores joined via `make` and model year | Explains insurance metrics (`symboling`, `normalized-losses`) and consumer safety preferences.                                              | High normalized-losses values lack context.

      "### Explanation for This Car's Prediction\n",
      "The model predicted this Toyota's price at **$6,417.97**, very close to its actual price of **$6,488.00** (only **$70.03 under**). Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Key features driving the prediction**:  \n",
      "   - **Engine size (92.0)**: Smaller engines typically lower costs. This modest size helped reduce the predicted price.  \n",
      "   - **Make (Toyota)**: Toyota is a reliable, mass-market brand, which usually means moderate pricing (not luxury-tier).  \n",
      "   - **Highway MPG (38)**: Excellent fuel efficiency makes this car economical to run, appealing to budget-conscious buyers and keeping the price competitive.  \n",
      "   - **Curb weight (2015 lbs)**: Lighter than average, suggesting a compact design. This often lowers manufacturing costs and final prices.  \n",
      "   - **Engine type (OHC)**: A common, standard engine typeâ€”not a high-end feature, so it doesnâ€™t push the price up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "   **Overall**: The combination of a small engine, efficient fuel use, lightweight build, and non-luxury brand made the model predict a **moderate, affordable price**. No rare or premium features (e.g., large engine, luxury brand) drove the cost higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prediction reliability**:  \n",
      "   This prediction is **highly reliable** because:  \n",
      "   - Toyota is a common brand, and features like OHC engines or 38 MPG are frequently seen in training data.  \n",
      "   - The carâ€™s specs are typical for its price rangeâ€”no unusual or rare characteristics that could confuse the model.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What the Overall Metrics Mean for You\n",
      "These metrics show how well the model performs **across all cars**, helping buyers, sellers, or dealers understand its accuracy:  \n",
      "- **Test RMSE ($2,718.37)**:  \n",
      "  The modelâ€™s predictions are typically **off by about $2,718** for unseen cars. For context:  \n",
      "  - If a car costs $10,000, the prediction might range between **$7,282â€“$12,718**.  \n",
      "  - This error is **moderate**â€”useful for ballpark estimates, but always pair it with expert judgment for pricing decisions.  \n",
      "\n",
